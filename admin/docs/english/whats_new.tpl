	<h3 id="section_whats_new_5_2_0">KVS v5.2.0 [25.06.2020]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Conversion engine improvements and optimizations:<br/>
			- Conversion engine will no more copy and duplicate source files when using local conversion servers. This
			  is designed to reduce filesystem load during content processing.<br/>
			- Better conversion process logging: video logs will become much shorter and won't contain ffmpeg logs if
			  everything works as planned.<br/>
			- Background tasks that are executed on primary server over a big set of data are revamped using iterative
			  approach. Such tasks, as creating a new screenshot format, will no more block conversion engine as it
			  happened before for projects with tons of content.<br/>
			- MP4 files post-processing was optimized: conversion engine will now check if the uploaded file needs any
			  post-processing and will skip it if not needed. This should further reduce filesystem load which is very
			  important when conversion is local.<br/>
			- Video formats now support up to 2 different watermarks at the same time. You can use this to show your
			  logo on top of video and moving text with your copyright in several fragments. In addition to that it
			  will be possible to specify different max width % values for horizontal and vertical videos, so that you
			  can fit watermark ideally in all cases.<br/>
			- Video and album logs will be automatically merged into smaller compressed archives to reduce disk space
			  usage.<br/>
			- In video format ffmpeg options you can now specify your custom video filters in -vf option that will be
			  combined together with the filters used by KVS.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Improvements in video screenshots:<br/>
			- We changed the way how screenshot cropping is applied. Previously KVS applied cropping when creating
			  screenshot formats, so that screenshot sources were not affected. We decided to change this concept for
			  all new videos: KVS will now apply cropping to screenshot sources and will save them in the cropped form.
			  Screenshot sources for old videos will be kept untouched.<br/>
			- In screenshot crop settings you can now enable automatic trimming of black regions. This option will be
			  switched on by default and will immediately affect all new videos.<br/>
			- We also changed the way how manually uploaded screenshots are processed. KVS will now provide options to
			  apply crop and watermarking to the manually uploaded screenshots as well, while previously it was not
			  possible at all.<br/>
			- With the help of these changes we also fixed old KVS problem, when creating new screenshot formats could
			  result in applying crop and watermark to the manually uploaded screenshots, which could then lead to
			  their quality loss for the new formats. This should never happen for new videos.<br/>
			- A new screenshot group was added for posters with its own separate set of screenshot formats. Posters can
			  only be uploaded manually in comparison to overview screenshots that can be either uploaded or created
			  from source.<br/>
			- Screenshots for vertical videos will be much better from now! First you can configure different resize
			  options for vertical and horizontal videos in screenshot formats. Secondly when video aspect ratio is
			  different from the required screenshot ratio (e.g. for vertical videos) KVS will create blurred
			  background instead of black bars.<br/>
			- We improved usability of the GUI when working with screenshots in admin panel.<br/>
			- Manual screenshot creation feature will now consider LA and time limits configured in content settings
			  for conversion engine, so that it is not possible to start these processes when these limits are hit.
			  Typically these limits are set to reduce load on your primary server during peak periods.<br/>
			- Mass edit GUI will now allow deleting overview screenshots (leaving only main screenshot) and also
			  re-creating any screenshot formats for the given set of videos.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Exporting feed enhancements:<br/>
			- It is now possible to export inactive videos via feeds.<br/>
			- Added a set of static categorization filters, so that you can better control which content appears in
			  feeds.<br/>
			- Added support for multiple traffic tracking parameters (previously it was possible to specify only one).
			  These parameters will be automatically attached to all URLs and embed codes served by feed.<br/>
			- Added support for satellites and ability to generate satellite URLs to the content.<br/>
			- Feed documentation page was enhanced to feed constructor form that will provide GUI to easily configure
			  all feed settings and get data in the needed format.<br/>
			- We changed how video format filters work in feeds. Previously these filters worked incorrectly and if a
			  video didn't contain the needed format, this video would be exported with other available video file.
			  With the new version feeds will return empty video files for all videos that don't have the asked format.
			  Due to that we also changed the naming for these filters - there will be <b>video_format_1</b> and
			  <b>video_format_2</b> instead of <b>video_format_standard</b> and <b>video_format_premium</b>. Any feed
			  URLs that are using old parameter naming will stop working after the update. In order to fix them, you
			  will have to open feed URL and re-select filters in the appearing form to get the new feed URL. You
			  should also understand that when using these filters some videos in the feed may have empty video file
			  and this should result in importing errors for these videos.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Importing feed enhancements:<br/>
			- Importing feeds in KVS format become more useful. First they will allow you to choose what data you want
			  them to import. Secondly, they will also support importing multiple video files for the same video,
			  similar to manual import. This can be used to import main files and video previews from one site to
			  another without the need to re-create them.<br/>
			- Feed logging becomes better; you can also configure how long a feed should store its logs, and it will
			  automatically clean them based on your settings.<br/>
			- Feeds can now auto-delete videos imported by them. For CSV feeds you will have to specify deleted videos
			  feed that provides video URLs to be deleted. This can only be used if in feed settings you selected video
			  URL to be the key field. For feeds in KVS format you don't need to specify anything as they will
			  automatically pull the needed data.<br/>
			- In feed settings you can now specify filtering by duration, rating, popularity and terminology. You can
			  use this to filter the imported data even if source feed doesn't support any filtering.<br/>
			- Finally we also added support for grabbers in feeds. This can be used to either grab from RSS channels,
			  or provide custom logic to generate the list of pages you want to grab from other sites.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS player and VAST enhancements:<br/>
			- Our player will now support multiple VAST advertisers in the same VAST response. This is used by some
			  advertising brokers to supply alternative advertisers for better conversion.<br/>
			- Player will now create a bit different HTML structure when displaying VPAID ads to allow better
			  integration with some advertisers that are sensitive to player HTML layout.<br/>
			- VAST timeout configured in player settings will now be applied to individual advertisers and not to the
			  whole VAST. This should allow alternate VAST advertisers to be displayed even if the primary advertiser
			  works slowly and triggers timeout.<br/>
			- Player settings will now allow specifying as many alternate VAST advertisers as needed. If this is set
			  up, alternate advertisers will be tried one by one until any of them displays non-empty ad.<br/>
			- Player will do better logging of advertising errors.<br/>
			- VAST profiles are enhanced in multiple ways. For each advertiser in VAST profile you can now configure
			  its specific alternate set of advertisers. Another important change is how you specify countries
			  filtering. Previously you should have normally configured at least one advertiser without any countries
			  filter, which would be used as default one. We considered this approach wrong and completely changed it.
			  With the new version you should explicitly specify whether a certain advertising should be switched on
			  for certain countries or should be switched off instead. So any advertiser with no countries will be
			  switched on for all countries as if there is no filtering enabled for it.<br/>
			- In addition to countries filtering we also added filtering by referrers to give you full control on when
			  particular advertisers should be switched on or off. A common issue with some traffic partners is that
			  they do not allow advertising of certain type or duration for their traffic. Such advertising typically
			  has better rates, but you are not allowed to use it if you buy traffic from these traffic partners. With
			  the new referrer filtering feature you will have freedom to use any advertising by adjusting it to be
			  switched off for parts of traffic that has any of such limitations.<br/>
			- Changing player settings will now automatically reset cache for video blocks. Therefore, new settings
			  will be put into effect immediately as you save them. Previously it could take up to several hours for
			  the updated player settings to be propagated to all your video pages.<br/>
			- VAST subscription key will now be automatically updated from KVS repository, so that you don't have to
			  manually update it in different player settings. It will also support aliases without the need to modify
			  templates.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Better stats:<br/>
			- Traffic and player stats will support segmentation by device type: desktops, phones and tablets. It can
			  be enabled in stats settings.<br/>
			- Player stats will support segmentation by embed code profiles. This is extremely useful if you use KVS
			  embed codes on multiple other projects and you want to have separate traffic analysis for them.<br/>
			- Traffic stats will also include video playbacks for having better outlook on traffic quality.<br/>
			- Search stats that are added manually in admin panel will not be auto-cleaned with search stats collected
			  from site users. Also in stats settings you can now force all user-submitted search queries to lower
			  case.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Brand new anti-spam module. It analyzes the history of posted data of the same type from a single IP /
			account, or from everyone. If this number exceeds the given limit (e.g. an IP will post more than 10
			comments during last 300 seconds, or all users in general will post more than 10 comments during last 300
			seconds), all future data of the same type (e.g. comments) from the given IP or from all users will be
			subject to the actions configured in settings. These actions include several levels of strictness: require
			captcha, deactivate on adding, silently delete or show an error.
		</li>
		<li>
			File upload switched to use chunked uploader that will allow supporting virtually any upload filesize limit
			configured on your server or proxy. This is very important for projects proxied by CloudFlare that imposes
			100mb upload filesize limit. Earlier it was possible to move upload to a subdomain in such cases, but now
			this should not be an issue anymore. Admin panel will start using new upload concept automatically after
			the update, but in order to switch site uploader you will have to update theme JS file. We will describe
			this procedure later on theme forum.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS switched to using the 'right' Memcached module. Earlier PHP5 supported 2 different similarly spelled
			modules and the one we used in KVS was dropped off with PHP7.
		</li>
		<li>
			Albums mass editing will allow re-creating any formats for the given set of albums individually. Earlier it
			was only possible to re-create album format for the whole set of albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			Browser filtering in advertising will now support Yandex and UCBrowser.
		</li>
		<li>
			Functionality to separate content between administrators was enhanced. It was possible to limit
			administrators to access only content where they are set as owners. But setting ownership was only allowed
			to superadmins and thus was not very convenient. This was changed, so that any admin with administration
			privilege can now adjust content ownership. Also, we added additional level to separate content using admin
			flags, which could be a better way to manage this. Finally, we also made it possible to deactivate admin
			users instead of deleting them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content import options will now allow disabling validation performed by grabbers. This validation is
			actually not needed and can even result in some issues, for example it can take long time and it can expose
			your server IP to be blocked.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content stats plugin has a better GUI now. This plugin will now list executions from the recent period and
			its results will separate disk space used on different storage groups.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category avatars generation plugin will now use the best actual screenshot by CTR when you have screenshot
			rotation enabled. Earlier this plugin used main screenshot in all cases.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS now supports integration with AWE Black Label via plugin. If you want to start using it, please contact
			our support.
		</li>
		<li>
			Storage servers testing was enhanced to validate SSL issues and report them as soon as they arise.
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin panel will now highlight inactive categorization objects in their selectors and will also allow
			filtering them out if needed.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS was changed to delete comments when users are deleted. This should be done using special "Delete with
			content" action. Earlier comments were not deleted but instead were switched to anonymous user, which was
			wrong when deleting spam accounts.
		</li>
		<li>
			Captcha support was added to <b>post_edit</b>, <b>playlist_edit</b> and <b>dvd_edit</b> blocks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Invite friend block functionality was finally removed. We recommend removing this link from your site
			footer as it will stop working anyway.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>logon</b> block we added support for SSO feature (Single Sign-On). This feature will be extremely
			useful for those who integrate KVS with their other member zones, for example forums. The key point is that
			you don't need to integrate your users into KVS, but instead you can just build a signed link to KVS site
			and display it to user at your end. By clicking this link user will be automatically logged in KVS with
			their account, and if there is no such user yet - it will be automatically created. Therefore, users logged
			in to your other platform can be securely logged in to KVS without any other effort on their integration.
		</li>
		<li>
			The logic for <b>randomize_positions</b> option in <b>list_videos</b> block was slightly changed. This
			parameter is used to insert random videos into video lists sorted by CTR, so that CTR is also calculated
			for other videos as well. Now the insertion will not be totally random - you can customize sorting for the
			inserted videos via a separate parameter <b>randomize_positions_sort_by</b>. Also, the inserted videos will
			now shift the original videos instead of replacing them, and CTR of the whole block will not be reduced.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_models</b> block you can now filter by custom fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_members</b> block you can now filter by member status.
		</li>
		<li>
			Empty search results will not use system 404 page if <b>search_empty_404</b> parameter is enabled. Instead,
			they will just return 404 status and show empty search results page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- <b>[SEVERE]</b> Export GUI didn't allow selecting more than 5 fields (regression after 5.1.0).<br/>
			- <b>[SEVERE]</b> Satellites displayed empty administrators in admin panel (regression after 5.1.1).<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> Search stats considered same queries with lowercase or uppercase letters as different
			  (regression after 5.1.1).<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> URL upload from site area could result in error for slow downloads.<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> Wrong <b>show_model_groups</b> behavior in <b>list_models</b> block.<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> KVS sometimes could delete /tmp directory.<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> NATS User Management postback could ignore some conversion events.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> For really big imports their validation process could last for days.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> In some cases stats could log future dates.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Stop words had higher priority than regex replacements.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Background tasks that have started their conversion would end up in error if conversion
			  server was deactivated.<br/>
		</li>

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_5_1_1">KVS v5.1.1 [15.10.2019]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Another set of player enhancements:<br/>
			- Changed VPAID architecture to display video slot inside VPAID iframe for better compatibility with
			  advertising vendors.<br/>
			- Player settings will now allow configuring VPAID timeout and the default timeout is increased twofold to
			  10 seconds. Unfortunately some VPAID vendors take longer time to initialize their ads, which may
			  negatively impact your site.<br/>
			- Player error logging can now be enabled in player settings.<br/>
			- Player keyboard skipping behavior was changed to provide better usability than before.<br/>
			- In VAST profiles we removed URL max length limit that didn't allow entering long URLs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Push notifications plugin will allow enabling notifications only for traffic from specific referrers (prior
			to that it was possible to disable notifications for traffic from specific referrers).
		</li>
		<li>
			Content localization will now check translated titles for duplicates.
		</li>
		<li>
			It will now be possible to separate stop words with new lines in addition to commas.
		</li>
		<li>
			Adding new languages will work in much optimal way now. Earlier adding a new language in a huge database
			could result in long database overload time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Grabbers plugin will now allow filtering imported video content by quality. This means you can configure
			any grabber to import only videos with 720p or above, or with 1080p or above.
		</li>
		<li>
			Google ReCAPTCHA plugin was updated to support specifying separate sets of keys for different alias domains
			if your project is working under several aliases at the same time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content import will now support additional option to optimize content copying using rename function for
			cases when source files are already uploaded to your server.
		</li>
		<li>
			NATS billing integration was subdivided into 2 separate processors: the old one is working using
			transaction postbacks (approval, rebill, refund, chargeback and etc.), and the new one is designed to work
			with User Management Postback. The key difference between them is how they handle user data. The new
			processor also supports users that are added manually in NATS and can update user passwords if they are
			updated in NATS, but it doesn't collect information about refunds or chargebacks as the old one. In
			addition to that KVS is now capable of using NATS API to notify NATS about email or password changes that
			happened in KVS backend for NATS users.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new option was added to tag settings that allows adding old tags as synonyms to new tags, when renaming
			tags in admin panel. Doing this is useful to prevent old tags from being added again and again. This option
			will be enabled by default, as we think this is the desired behavior for tag rename process.
		</li>
		<li>
			Plugins page in admin panel was optimized to work much faster than before.
		</li>
		<li>
			In Content settings it is now possible to limit download speed for downloads operated by KVS itself (during
			import or remote file upload). This can be used to reduce overload caused by import.
		</li>
		<li>
			Custom grabbers will now support post-processing function that will be executed after each grabbed content
			item is created in KVS database and its ID gets available. This can be used to grab comments in addition to
			main content.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category synonyms can now support partial match using * symbol. This can be useful if you want to import a
			set of similar spelled categories as a 1 single category - in this case instead of listing all possible
			combinations you can use partial match. Please note that partial match considers word boundary.
		</li>
		<li>
			In referral registration award configuration it will now be possible to configure IP uniqueness check
			period to avoid users having multiple awards for registrations from the same IP.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> CCBill processor would end up in error if postback is executed using non-existing access
			  package ID (regression after 5.0.0).<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> CCBill processor would add member normally for some denial codes where no member should
			  actually be added.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> KVS displayed false error on conversion server if it took more than 2 minutes to process
			  tasks on it (regression after 5.1.0).<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Models list in admin panel didn't render age value (regression after 5.0.0).<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> FFmpeg could create huge log files in some rare cases that would block KVS conversion
			  engine.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> No error was considered when trying to add WebP format and missing WebP converter support in
			  ImageMagick.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Stats will not show comparison with average for today date anymore as this makes no
			  sense.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Anonymous users could set private content type that in fact should not be used when
			  uploading content anonymously.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Grabbers import didn't check titles for duplicates prior to downloading files, which
			  resulted in nonoptimal import behavior for duplicate cases.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_5_1_0">KVS v5.1.0 [29.07.2019]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added support for WebP format in video screenshots. WebP is a modern image format promoted by Google and
			supported by major browsers (79.96% support coverage at this moment). The key feature of this format is
			HUGE - 30-50% - image size reduction in comparison with JPG while keeping visual quality almost the same.
			Since this format is not 100% supported, it can only be used as an addition to standard JPG format.
		</li>
		<li>
			Huge set of KVS player enhancements:<br/>
			- Fully supports VAST 3.0 spec (except industry icons, as we never had an example of any KVS customer
			  using it). This specifically means that KVS player now supports wrappers and advanced VAST loading
			  techniques.<br/>
			- Fully supports VPAID 2.0 spec.<br/>
			- We changed the way how player requests VAST XML file. Previously it loaded VAST during player
			  initialization in order to avoid any further delays when starting player. This approach worked
			  incorrectly together with 3rd-party popunders, because in most cases player page would be displayed twice
			  for the same user and KVS player didn't have any chance to know this fact, so that it could avoid VAST
			  loading. The new approach will work similarly to other players, e.g. will load VAST only when clicked.
			  We believe this will improve VAST performance for most KVS customers.<br/>
			- Mobile devices will start pre-loading main video during pre-roll advertising display. This should result
			  in less time waiting for video to start, because in most cases video file will be buffered when user is
			  watching pre-roll.<br/>
			- We changed controlbar behavior on touch devices when displaying pre-roll / post-roll ads. Previously
			  controlbar was auto-hiding and displaying back on first touch on advertising, which may have resulted in
			  less clicks and smaller CTR. We fixed that to never hide controlbar during advertising display on touch
			  devices.<br/>
			- We fixed volume button to allow reducing volume during advertising display (mostly desktops as mobiles
			  may not support this). Previously it only supported mute / unmute options.<br/>
			- We added support for player stats in KVS and Google Analytics. In Stats settings it will now be possible
			  to enable stats for player events and choose where to collect them.<br/>
			- Also in Stats settings it will be possible to enable counting of playback events for every video. By
			  default KVS counts only 'view' event, which is basically the fact of opening video player page. With this
			  player update, it will also be possible to count a separate number of how many times a specific video was
			  played by player.<br/>
			- <b>IMPORTANT!</b> All player skins are updated due to these changes. If you are using custom player skin
			  you should also update it accordingly, because KVS will not auto-update your custom player skin.
		</li>
		<li>
			Adspyglass.com is now amoung free VAST providers list that do not require VAST subscription code from KVS!
			It provides integration with more than 30 popular VAST advertisers and may increase your advertising
			revenue without any effort from your side by automatically displaying best paid ads for every specific
			visitor based on their device and location.
		</li>
		<li>
			Player stats were enhanced to provide more complex data than before. You can now use them to compare
			traffic quality from different sources (by using KVS referrer settings). If you buy or trade traffic from
			multiple sources, you can change stats grouping so that each row in stats indicate traffic from separate
			referrer. By comparing discrepancy between AVG value and actual value (shown as +-% in brackets) you can
			easily detect cheaters and bad traffic, as it is very unlikely that they can emulate the same behavioral
			pattern for player events as real traffic shows.
		</li>
		<li>
			All traffic stats were enhanced to better GUI with ability to display more data columns and analytics
			function.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS will now support animated GIFs as video formats. It will be possible to define GIF format similarly to
			other video formats and require KVS to create GIF image from any uploaded video based on duration and
			trailer settings. For example it will be possible to create 5-seconds GIF trailers from every video.
		</li>
		<li>
			CTR rotator functionality was enhanced in several ways:<br/>
			- First of all, we updated its old calculation method that resulted in slowing down CTR calculation. New
			  rotator logic brings immediate CTR values that reflect the most clickable videos as they are at the given
			  moment. Website caching will not affect CTR calculation anymore.<br/>
			- Another important enhancement is ability to configure random video inclusions when rendering videos by
			  CTR. For example if you have already a set of videos sorted by CTR, you can allow some random videos to
			  be displayed at several positions, so that new videos have bigger chance to get some clicks and make
			  their way to the top. This should be configured per-list in <b>list_videos</b> block parameters
			  (<b>randomize_positions</b> parameter added).<br/>
			- Finally we did some performance improvements in the area and came to enhancements that will reduce
			  database load during CTR recalculation. We also added Schedule option in Rotator settings that allows
			  increasing intervals between CTR recalculations, and also provides ability to configure 'quiet' period so
			  that rotator is not generating any additional load when your server is under heavy traffic.
		</li>
		<li>
			In tag settings it will now be possible to configure that all new tags are created in inactive status and
			do not appear on site without manually activating them.
		</li>
		<li>
			In Personal settings we returned back the option that allowed configuring maximum thumb size in admin panel
			lists. This option was previously removed with 5.0 changes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In admin panel it will be possible now to configure Anonymous user as default user for any content.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added display of embed code stats on start page in admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			In billings we added support for repeating transaction postback if it resulted in error. In order to allow
			that we got back email and password logging into billing logs, that has been previously removed as part of
			4.0.2 update.
		</li>
		<li>
			Import GUI was updated to show examples of expected values for each data column. Also support for Access
			level option was added for videos and albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			In comments we changed the way how admin panel displays long comments in the list. Previously any comment
			longer than 200 characters would be truncated from the end. In the update we changed this to truncate the
			middle part, so that beginning and end of comment is always visible. Also we added additional column that
			can render full comment without any truncation, regardless of its length.
		</li>
		<li>
			Storage server validation checks will now send referer header to avoid some special configurations that
			don't allow empty referers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Backup plugin will use better naming convention for created backups.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS conversion engine will not support FLV output formats anymore as they are obsolete.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>video_edit</b> and <b>album_edit</b> blocks it is now possible to specify access level field.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>signup</b> and <b>member_profile_edit</b> blocks KVS will now fully verify the specified birth date
			to comply with minimum allowed age configured in <b>setup.php</b> (set to 18 years by default). Previously
			this option was used to limit the choice of available years in date selectors, but KVS never verified that
			the specified birth date was in the range of allowed full years.
		</li>
		<li>
			If multiple active storage servers are located in the same group and KVS detects error in any of them, this
			server won't be used to serve content right a way.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- <b>[CRITICAL]</b> NATS payment processor would result in processing error if no access packages were
			  created for it (regression after 5.0).<br/>
			- <b>[SEVERE]</b> Broken video files may appear when video format was recreated from itself and conversion
			  engine was not able to fully copy it to storage server due to network error.<br/>
			- <b>[SEVERE]</b> Model and content source functionality resulted in SQL errors under MySQL 8.<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> In some cases when background tasks were manually deleted, video source files would not
			  be deleted.<br/>
			- <b>[MEDIUM]</b> Model and content source ranking would calculate incorrectly in random cases.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Importing feeds incorrectly displayed the amount of deleted videos (regression after 5.0).<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Categories autoselection plugin did not consider tags correctly when using mixed case (e.g.
			  Tag1 vs tag1).<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Bad screenshot detection logic worked incorrectly for some videos and could result in much
			  slower screenshot creation.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Player would sometimes render +1 timeline screenshot that did not exist and resulted in 404
			  error.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> FTP content uploader plugin would allow importing premium videos even if no premium formats
			  were defined.<br/>
			- <b>[LOW]</b> Comments would be shifted to future dates when shifting post date of a video or album.

	<h2 id="section_whats_new_5_0">KVS v5.0</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_5_0_1">KVS v5.0.1 [17.04.2019]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Finally possible to update from 4.x to 5.0 using beta update procedure.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Empty line in the end of import data forced import validation step to hang.<br/>
			- Channel groups could not be created in admin panel.<br/>
			- Admin password change worked incorrectly in satellites.<br/>
			- Import feeds incorrectly processed some video galleries.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_5_0_0">KVS v5.0.0 [24.03.2019]</h3>
	<p>
		<b>KVS turns 10 years! 10 years ago in February 2009 we announced our first public release. Since that time we
		released almost 60 new versions and added almost 1000 new features. Happy anniversary and keep going!</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		This version was initially planned as 4.1, however due to migration to PHP7 it resulted in so many changes and
		incompatibilities, that we decided to change it to 5.0 and start new branch cycle.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			PHP 7 support implemented. This brought huge amount of changes in KVS code and now most of custom PHP changes will
			probably stop working and will require adjustments. This won't affect any theme customizations done in templates if they
			do not change any PHP code in KVS. Use audit plugin to find list of custom PHP files and custom changes in KVS system
			files: these are located by running installation and security checks.
		</li>
		<li>
			We fully re-wrote billings API and all payment processors currently integrated into KVS. Now adding a new payment
			processor will be a simple coding task that doesn't require knowledge of KVS data structure. All existing payment
			processors, where supported at billing level, were updated with trial feature. KVS supports trials in multiple ways:
			trial users may have premium access or they may have standard access with some predefined number of tokens assigned to
			their profiles. This lets configuring different access levels for trial and non-trial members; and tokens are useful in
			configuring limits on the number of accessible content (e.g. trial users may only be allowed to watch max 5 videos that
			should be unlocked with tokens).
		</li>
		<li>
			All categorization objects will now have status field and ability to deactivate them. Deactivated objects will not
			be displayed in lists, but will be accessible via direct URLs. Also in satellites it will now be possible to
			individually configure which categorization is visible on which particular satellite.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings we introduced brand new categorization settings section with a set of tag creation rules. Tags
			in comparison to other categorization objects are truly dynamic, they are auto-created from various sources such
			as import, grabbers and even by site users when tagging content. Now you have ability to control tag auto-creation
			process. For example you can disallow too short or too long tags, tags that are common language words such as "and" and
			"or", tags with specific symbols. These rules will affect all data flows where tags are auto-created, except tag editor
			in admin panel. In tag editor you will still be able to manually create any tags you want.
		</li>
		<li>
			Albums now support PNG and GIF files, including animated GIFs. The support we added here is only partial: thumbs of
			any uploaded images will still have JPG format (animated GIFs will have their first frame as thumb). But anyway it
			will allow watching the originally uploaded image in the original format.
		</li>
		<li>
			Big changes came to search queries in KVS. In new version we optimized storage structure for them, so that their
			display performance increased more than 10x for big databases. In addition to that we also added support for admins to
			manually create / import search queries for SEO coverage.
		</li>
		<li>
			Advertising adblock protection was added in cooperation with Clickaine advertising company. This functionality is
			designed to reduce the chance of blocking ads on your site and increase your tube revenue. We will continue looking at
			what Google and other browsers do in terms of adblocking. As you may know, Google is going to bundle their own
			adblocking software into Chrome in July 2019, which may affect advertising market. Starting with KVS 5.0 we will
			investigate this in more details to protect KVS users from these upcoming changes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and album lists in admin panel you can now choose displayable columns right there - previously it was
			configurable via personal settings. In general, column selectors were added to many other lists in admin panel, but
			still not everywhere. We will continue finalizing them in the upcoming updates, only few left. In all lists where
			applicable we added support for enabling thumb column display, plus you can now enable any file columns as well. Finally
			in 5.0 we added support for column reordering, so you can now customize comfortable list display configuration almost
			everywhere in admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			We added support for users to earn tokens for referring other users to register at your site. In order to enable this
			functionality you should go to memberzone settings and configure affiliate parameter there and the number of tokens to
			grant for a referring free signup. Then you should render referral link in user's profile using this parameter name
			and user's ID; this link will be used by users to send new users to your site. It is possible to earn tokens from paid
			registration as well, but only when they use access codes. In this case you should configure tokens award when creating
			access codes, because different access codes may have different amount.
		</li>
		<li>
			Remote file check was enhanced to support HTTP/2 server responses.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models will now support grouping similar to categories.
		</li>
		<li>
			Passwords for users and administrators will now be stored in more secure way. It will also be possible to customize
			passwords hashing method, which will now allow seamless migration of users from other scripts where other password
			hashing method is being used. For better security it is recommended to change your superadmin password after updating
			to 5.0 in personal settings. You can use the same password as before.
		</li>
		<li>
			Plugins that are based on schedule (template cache cleanup, avatar generation, backup) can now be configured to run
			at specific time interval. This is useful if you have multiple KVS projects installed on the same server and want to
			make sure that resourceful operations are run at different time.
		</li>
		<li>
			We enhanced the way how stop words work in KVS. Previously stop words that did not contain star symbol (*) worked
			incorrectly. For example if you had a "word" and "[del]" as a replacement, KVS would replace "wording" with "[del]ing",
			which didn't look good. Now such words will only be considered as whole words, and if you want to have a partial match,
			you should use star symbol, e.g. "word*". This will affect both "word" and "wording". In addition to that you can now
			configure you own regex replacement rules that will affect all content submitted by users.
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin panel will now have better performance on huge databases. If on some lists you experience slow list
			generation, you can simply disable (hide) some aggregation columns for better list performance.
		</li>
		<li>
			All categorization editors in admin panel will now support Save & edit next flow similar to what we previously had
			for content editors.
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin users and groups, and also site users, will now support text descriptions in their editors.
		</li>
		<li>
			In backup plugin we changed the way how player settings get stored. Previously player settings were stored
			together with site templates and there was a separate option to backup embed player settings. In 5.0 we decided to
			merge them into a separate backup option that will backup both player and embed player settings, plus VAST profiles.
		</li>
		<li>
			Handling of proxy settings in grabbers plugin was enhanced. They will now be used both in youtube-dl and cURL
			requests. Also in settings of individual grabbers it will be possible to configure login details that should be used to
			access protected content.
		</li>
		<li>
			Grabbers will now support additional terminology filter that allows skipping content with specific words in title.
		</li>
		<li>
			Countries in admin panel were grouped by continents for your convenience.
		</li>
		<li>
			We changed the way how <b>xxx_view</b> and <b>xxx_comments</b> blocks are cached for members. This should result in reducing the
			number of trash cache files and in general reduce the number of cache files without significant performance impact.
		</li>
		<li>
			All website blocks were grouped by category and block type. All block parameters were grouped by their logic and
			interconnections. 45 of 60 blocks were updated with new default templates and new documentation. New default templates
			are designed to render all possible data fields / actions and should work right a way with the default theme JS file.
			You just need to add some styling and layout to make them look good in your theme style.
		</li>
		<li>
			When configuring advanced content filtering on satellites, KVS will not only hide the filtered content from lists,
			but will also return 404 via direct URL for such content. Advanced filtering is used on satellites to limit set of
			content available there using the customized query logic.
		</li>
		<li>
			Members can now create posts with the help of new <b>post_edit</b> block.
		</li>
		<li>
			In comment blocks it is now possible to sort comments by their rating. You can now render top rated comment for
			any content with adding additional comment block to the page and configuring it with <b>items_per_page=1</b> and
			<b>sort_by=rating</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Members can now log in not only with their usernames, but with emails as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>search_results</b> block it is now possible to configure similarity criteria when displaying similar queries using
			<b>search_method</b> parameter: it can be by fulltext index, by full match or by partial match.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>video_view</b> and <b>album_view</b> blocks we changed the way how watching limit works (limit max N videos during M
			seconds). Previously it was based on cookies and was good at performance, but at the same time allowed users to reset
			their cookies and reset limit. We switched this limit calculation to be IP-based. If you have it enabled, you may
			experience database load increase after the update.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- When creating or deleting timeline screenshot formats, KVS would iterate over all videos, even if only few had
			  timelines enabled. This would result in slow task processing for big databases.<br/>
			- When restarting failed conversion tasks for new videos or albums, KVS would leave junk files on some storage servers
			  in some rare cases.<br/>
			- Player fullscreen not always worked correctly on iPads with the new iOS version (this fix was previously announced
			  via forum as a hotfix for player after 4.0.4).<br/>
			- Category and model selectors in admin panel worked incorrectly when copy-pasting combined list of items, and also
			  would sometimes result in creating similar categories or models with different lower / upper case.<br/>
			- Player was fixed to avoid showing VAST pre-roll in mobile UC Browser, since this browser does not follow HTML5
			  standards and thus doesn't allow showing skip button correctly. Currently all other players also have this issue; we
			  may come with another solution in future.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_4_0_4">KVS v4.0.4 [12.10.2018]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Player not working on new Android 9 phones.<br/>
			- Push notifications JS file updated as required by advertiser.<br/>
			- Grabbers plugin will show better progress indicator when grabbing a big set of videos or albums from a
			  single list URL.<br/>
			- Background tasks that deleted video format or timeline screenshots iterated through all videos and could
			  result in long operation time for slow storage server connection.<br/>
			- Removed 200 characters limit when configuring storage servers load balancing by countries.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_4_0_3">KVS v4.0.3 [04.09.2018]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Set of player enhancements and fixes:<br/>
			- Player logo can now be defined as text in addition to image file.<br/>
			- Mobile player GUI will now support timeline screenshots when touching timeline.<br/>
			- The way how player popunder works was changed. Popunder will now be installed on all devices rather than
			  on devices that support autoplay). In order to return back to the old behavior a new option was added to
			  popunder settings.<br/>
			- Video advertising initial volume will now be set in the same way as for main video: based on previous
			  user settings or from default volume in player settings for a new user.<br/>
			- Pre-roll repeat option can now be set in 2 ways: either after each N videos or after each N minutes.<br/>
			- Post-roll advertising will support 'after pause' mode, which is designed to increase the number of
			  post-roll impressions. You can now use 3rd-party VAST providers in post-roll ads as well.<br/>
			- For pre-roll and post-roll VAST it will be possible to configure alternate providers that will be used
			  when primary providers return empty response.<br/>
			- VAST spec implementation was enhanced to support all needed events and common macros in VAST URLs.<br/>
			- A new option was added in pre-roll VAST settings that will force player to take logo from VAST
			  advertising. Such behavior is required by some VAST providers.<br/>
			- Player autoplay will now affect pre-roll advertising as well: on desktops player will autoplay pre-roll
			  if configured.<br/>
			- Fixed bug with not showing start screen advertising when VAST provider returned empty response.<br/>
			- Fixed bug when pre-roll advertising installed for popunder configuration as well.<br/>
			- Fixed bug with autoplay in desktop Chrome.<br/>
			- Fixed bug with dynamic HTTP parameters not working in player HTML advertising.<br/>
			- Fixed bug with missing player related videos if VAST advertising was installed.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Support for VAST profiles was added. VAST profiles will allow creating your custom strategies of VAST
			advertising. They will help you to maximize your VAST revenue by targeting different VAST providers for
			different countries and also by using multiple providers at the same time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Set of enhancements in grabbers:<br/>
			- Almost all video grabbers were migrated to youtube-dl. You can now use multi-threaded downloaders with
			  these grabbers (for example aria2) and increase download speed to virtually no limits. Also in many
			  grabbers we added support for content source data field.<br/>
			- Grabbers can now support custom fields and video grabbers will also support channel data for grabbers
			  that support content source data. Channel data will have the same value as content source data, but one
			  may need to save it either as content source or as channel based on their categorization structure.<br/>
			- Grabbers now support filtering by content views. This filtering makes sense in conjunction with rating
			  filtering, so that when you want to grab top rated content, grabbers don't grab content with dozen of
			  views, since its rating value may not yet been stabilized.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			A new plugin was added to provide integration with push notifications service. Using push notifications is
			a brand new monetization channel that you should definitely use to increase your tube revenue.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video format settings you can now connect start / end duration offsets to content source custom fields.
			You can use this functionality to remove advertising intro from the imported videos and specify different
			into duration for videos from different sources.
		</li>
		<li>
			In memberzone settings it is now possible to configure token awards for embed code views for the videos
			uploaded by members. These awards will work in the same way as for video views, but they will only count
			views via embed codes (they will not consider views for these videos on your site).
		</li>
		<li>
			In emailing you can now export member emails instead of directly emailing them; thus you can use 3rd-party
			emailing solution at any time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Limited admin panel access groups will now allow extending their permissions for individual administrators.
		</li>
		<li>
			Template cache cleanup plugin was optimized in terms of file system utilization, so that it will produce
			slightly less load now.
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin panel categorization selectors enhanced their usability with sorting option and ability to switch off
			grouping.
		</li>
		<li>
			In videos export it is now possible to export duration, dimensions and filesize of any video format.
		</li>
		<li>
			In importing feeds it is now possible to configure specific channel for all videos imported by the given 
			feed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Models did not force validation for duplicate titles.<br/>
			- Some filters did not work in album grabbers.<br/>
			- Files greater than 64 KB were truncated in template change history.<br/>
			- When deleting videos or albums that were in processing state and their tasks have already been copied to
			  conversion servers, these tasks would not be deleted and would slow down conversion servers for some
			  time.<br/>
			- Admin panel visual security was slightly enhanced: limited admin users will not be able to see names of
			  other admin users in the system; also they will not see system LA and free disk space displayed in admin
			  panel header.<br/>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_4_0_2">KVS v4.0.2 [17.05.2018]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added Google ReCAPTCHA integration, which allows replacing all KVS captcha. In order for it to work
			correctly, massive theme template changes are required. They will be described on forum.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS will now support dynamic pricing from CCBill added as a separate payment processor (CCBill Dynamic
			Pricing).
		</li>
		<li>
			In paid access package settings you can now enable filtering by countries, so that certain access packages
			are only available for certain countries. This will let you configure access packages in different
			currencies; also you can use this feature to make special offers for different market segments.
		</li>
		<li>
			It will now be allowed to change conversion server libraries configuration directly from admin panel.
			Previously if you needed to change this, you could do only via conversion server file system.
		</li>
		<li>
			In models death date field was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			In grabbers we changed the way how the time part of publishing date is populated. Previously you could
			configure to take publishing date from the source site, but its time part was always randomized between
			00:00 and 23:59. Now we added additional option to enable time randomization, and if the option is not
			enabled, grabber will set time to the current server time as the new default behavior.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video quick preview in admin panel will not open a separate window anymore, it will show a modal layer on
			top of existing window.
		</li>
		<li>
			When displaying list of site pages and if your page components have a lot of global blocks used in them
			(e.g. header, footer), these global blocks will be listed for all site pages and make page list display too
			cluttered. We fixed that by grouping such global blocks under the single row with ability to expand it.
		</li>
		<li>
			We started a long-running task to refactor block parameters and documentation. Block parameters will be
			logically grouped and displayed in similar grouped way, so that they are easier to understand and navigate.
			Block documentation will be updated with the latest scenarios and practices. Block default templates will
			also be updated to render all possible data fields (all possible input field for form blocks). This will
			let you easily render the needed data by simply copy-pasting the needed code from default template of a
			block. This is a multiple-version task: since we have almost 60 blocks it will take some time for us to
			silently update them all.
		</li>
		<li>
			In response to GDPR enforcement we reviewed data sets stored by KVS for registered members and made some
			fixes to reduce data storage in certain cases. Starting from 4.0.2 KVS will not keep login and transaction
			logs anymore when a member is deleted from KVS. We will also provide a statement on our forum to describe
			information that is being used and stored by KVS for registered members.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models (<b>list_models</b>) and categories (<b>list_categories</b>) list blocks were extended with ability
			to display list of related models (categories) by videos and albums they are used together with the current
			model (category).
		</li>
		<li>
			In signup block you can now configure that access code field is required; so that only users who have
			access code can register.
		</li>
		<li>
			In logon block it is now possible to restrict only users with webmaster status to log in. This option may
			be useful if you want to separate memberzone into members and webmasters, which all have different
			functionality.
		</li>
		<li>
			In logon block it will also be possible to set up 3rd-party callback for logging all login events. If you
			are using NATS, it provides such callback script to record all logins for additional analysis.
		</li>
		<li>
			In internal messages list block (<b>list_messages</b>) it is now possible to batch approve or reject all
			pending friendship invitations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added several display modes in mixed content list block (<b>list_content</b>) to align this block with
			standalone video / album lists.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Exoclick should now correctly consider all VAST stats from KVS player.<br/>
			- When start screen advertising was enabled together with VAST, start screen advertising was not
			  clickable.<br/>
			- The option to skip N videos before showing the next pre-roll ad was distorting VAST advertiser stats, as
			  player requested VAST tag even if advertising was not displayed. Now it was fixed to only load VAST tag
			  when pre-roll is going to be displayed.<br/>
			- Vertical videos were handled incorrectly with the new ffmpeg versions.<br/>
			- Fixed memory leak in mass editing and content stats plugin when processing huge amount of videos.<br/>
			- When videos half-processing was enabled, secondary tasks had default priority; should have had the same
			  priory as primary task's priority was.<br/>
			- In some rare cases uploading new photos to existing albums would result in background task error without
			  no reason.<br/>
			- In category groups list block (list_categories_groups) there was incorrect avatar URL rendered.<br/>
			- Tag directory was not always re-generated correctly.<br/>
			- Model auto-selection plugin didn't consider models with numbers in their titles.<br/>
			- No error message was shown when uploading ZIP archives that are password protected.<br/>
			- Grabbers will not be using GoogleBot user agent anymore. This allowed some sites to block such
			  requests.<br/>
			- Category avatar generation plugin and videos sub-selection for each category in category list block did
			  not consider category CTR stats correctly when using CTR sorting. They were using global CTR stats
			  instead of category-specific CTR stats.<br/>
			- When upload was configured via subdomain, it would stop working if enable uploader access restriction
			  that we've added in 4.0.1.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_4_0_1">KVS v4.0.1 [16.02.2018]</h3>
	<p>
		Several player enhancements:<br/>
		- It will now be possible to use 3rd-party VAST providers for a subscription. At the moment subscription will
		  be free for beta testing period.<br/>
		- Advertising would not disappear anymore after being clicked.<br/>
		- Enhanced adblock player feature. Now you can configure the amount of time in seconds that adblock user will
		  be allowed to watch. After that player will emulate crash with showing your predefined HTML code instead.<br/>
		- Added support for inline playback on iPhones, which will also allow showing pre-roll advertising on Iphone
		  devices.<br/>
		- Fixed mute button behavior on mobile devices. Previously it was not displayed for mobile devices.
	</p>
	<p>
		In videos export and exporting feeds it will now be possible to format duration in HH:MM:SS format.
	</p>
	<p>
		Comments list block (<b>list_comments</b>) will support additional mode to display comments to the whole user's
		content.
	</p>
	<p>
		Channels list block (<b>list_dvds</b>) will support a new mode that allows listing channels available for
		upload to the given user based on their privacy settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several new modes were added for mixed videos and albums list block (<b>list_content</b>). They will allow to
		display uploaded content, purchased content and content from subscriptions of a given user.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
		- In some cases moving watermark was not applied to videos.
	</p>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_4_0_0">KVS v4.0.0 [15.01.2018]</h3>
	<p>
		Starting with KVS 4th generation we would like to change the way we approach to versioning and update policy.
		Earlier KVS had branches (1.x, 2.x, 3.x) and all updates within a branch were free, but updating to a new
		branch cost 25% of a new license price for each individual license. Many successful years passed and KVS now
		has many customers with big number of licenses on their accounts, so updating them all to KVS 4 will mean huge
		money for them.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a result we have re-balanced our update policy:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			- With regard to versioning we will not use 'branch' term anymore, all new versions will be of 2 types:
			  major feature updates (e.g. 4.1, 4.2, etc.) and minor bugfixing updates (4.0.1, 4.0.2). Minor versions
			  will be announced as usual, but we won't make them available publicly if no critical bugfixes, they will
			  be available on request only. Changing this approach will let us introduce important bugfixes instantly
			  without considering major version current state.
		</li>
		<li>
			- Access to any updates will now cost $100 yearly per customer and it doesn't matter how many licenses you
			  have. Any new Ultimate license purchase will give +1 year of free updates since the day of purchase. Any
			  new other license purchase will give +0.5 year of free updates since the day of purchase.
		</li>
		<li>
			- All clients who've purchased a new Ultimate license since 15.01.2017 or any other new license since
			  15.07.2017 will have free access to 4.0 update. For convenience we will update our customer zone with
			  this info soon.
		</li>
		<li>
			- All unused licenses will be using the latest version at any time, they will not be connected to any dates.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What's new in 4.0.0</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Global enhancements in advertising module:<br/>
			- Ability to restrict individual ads to certain devices, browsers and member statuses.<br/>
			- Ability to restrict individual ads to be displayed during specific time interval (for example starting on
			  22:00 and ending on 02:00 every day).<br/>
			- Ability to configure advertising start / end datetime with 1 minute precision.<br/>
			- Ability to exclude specific advertising from being displayed for certain categories.<br/>
			- Advertising spots now allow configuring wrapped HTML code, so that no empty advertising block is
			  displayed when there is nothing to display inside it.<br/>
			- Player HTML advertising can now be connected to advertising spots and thus provides easy way to use all
			  the advertising module functionality inside player.<br/>
			- Adblock plugin should not prevent saving advertising in KVS admin panel anymore.
		</li>
		<li>
			Many enhancements in conversion module:<br/>
			- Video trailer creation optimized, now trailers are created much faster and with less quality loss. Also
			  it is now possible to add cross-fade effects to trailers.<br/>
			- Moving watermarks are now supported with ability to set speed, direction and any number of positions in
			  seconds and percents for repeat.<br/>
			- Ability to switch new videos conversion into 2-phased process: the first phase will only create all
			  required video formats, the second phase will create all high-res formats which are typically declared as
			  conditionally-optional. Thus video will become available faster, no need to wait for all video formats to
			  be created.<br/>
			- Added ability to optionally enable screenshot crop settings for manually uploaded screenshots. Previously
			  crop was never used for uploaded screenshots.<br/>
			- Background tasks logging was enhanced. Now background task log can show info about all conversion phases
			  and most importantly subtasks and their duration.<br/>
			- It is now possible to code a custom PHP script to set up individual crop, rotation or mirroring of a
			  source file for any uploaded video. These options are not exposed for public usage, as they are too
			  specific for most users.<br/>
			- KVS will now support uploading audio files directly into MP3 format. In order to use this functionality
			  you should add mp3 extension into list of allowed video extensions in <b>/admin/include/setup.php</b>,
			  and also upload screenshots for every such video.
		</li>
		<li>
			Big set of KVS player enhancements and fixes:<br/>
			- Ability to enable auto preload, which gives hint to all devices to start optimistic video buffering
			  before user starts playing.<br/>
			- Ability to show related videos on pause (if no pause advertising is configured).<br/>
			- Ability to show global video duration in player instead of current format duration. This may be useful
			  for paysites if non-premium users are only able to watch short trailers - then it is better to show full
			  video duration instead of trailer duration.<br/>
			- All player HTML advertising is now fully integrated into KVS advertising module.<br/>
			- For pre-roll and post-roll advertising the updated skins will show timeline with advertising
			  duration.<br/>
			- For pre-roll and post-roll advertising it is now possible to enable VAST from several supported
			  providers.<br/>
			- For pre-roll advertising you can now configure so that it is not displayed for every single video, but
			  can skip some videos before next display.<br/>
			- In embed player settings you can now set caching interval for embed codes. Previously embed codes were
			  automatically cached up to 24 hours.<br/>
			- Fixed wrong behavior of buffer indicator when skipping or switching to another format.<br/>
			- Fixed timeline screenshots display issue in some browsers.<br/>
			- Fixed full-screen issue in desktop safari.
		</li>
		<li>
			Several important enhancements in KVS storage system:<br/>
			- Added support for syncing one storage server from another storage server if they are located in the same
			  storage group. This task is basically required when you move content from one server to another or when
			  you want to duplicate content between several storage servers for load balancing. Previously you could
			  only do that manually, now KVS can do that for you.<br/>
			- We extended CDN invalidation API to support additional parameter that describes operation type (add,
			  update or delete). Thus invalidation API will be executed also when new content is added into CDN.<br/>
			- You can now disable storage groups, so that they are not used in new content allocation.<br/>
			- IP whitelist configured in video anti-hotlink protection settings will now disable all protection levels
			  for the given IPs, including status-based protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Set of grabber plugin enhancements:<br/>
			- Ability to configure command line path to youtube-dl library with all the supported command line
			  options.<br/>
			- For grabbers based on youtube-dl KVS will also download video files via youtube-dl, which will allow
			  using aria2 library for multi-threaded downloads without speed limit.<br/>
			- For grabbers based on youtube-dl it will be possible to configure proxy servers list if your server's IP
			  gets blocked.<br/>
			- All existing grabbers will be switched to youtube-dl soon.
		</li>
		<li>
			Several changes in FTP content upload plugin:<br/>
			- Ability to specify video / album description in a separate TXT file.<br/>
			- Ability to randomize order in which content will be added.<br/>
			- Added display info about duplicates, if detected.
		</li>
		<li>
			Image size settings were enhanced with additional resize type option that will allow now having images with
			dynamic size (previously it was only possible to have fixed size images for categories, models and etc).
			Also for categories and members we added 2nd size, so now all images support 2 separate sizes with different
			resize types. Due to categories avatar migration to a new storage structure it will be needed to modify
			some code in templates. After update audit plugin will show KVS #10 issue. Please create a support ticket
			specifying all domains you've updated and make sure that support access is enabled there.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS now supports internal paid subscriptions for members and channels using tokens. When purchasing a
			subscription, members will get premium access to all content from the member or channel they are
			subscribing to, including any content added in the future by this member or into this channel. A
			subscription can be time-limited or unlimited (configurable by admin). Limited paid subscriptions will be
			automatically renewed if a member has enough tokens on balance. Otherwise the subscription will expire and
			member will need to purchase it again to get access. Same as with individual content purchasing, KVS will
			allow you to set that part of spent tokens are earned by content authors, so that you can have members
			earning tokens from selling subscriptions to their profiles and channels. In member profile editing and
			channel editing blocks it is now possible to specify tokens price in tokens_required field.
		</li>
		<li>
			For premium access packages you can now choose whether they are available on signup, upgrade or both. This
			option can be used for instance to provide some discounts for returning members, while having the full
			price for new members.
		</li>
		<li>
			Premium access packages can now be purchased with tokens. We added a specific payment processor for
			handling this named <b>Internal Tokens</b>. So if your site offers free and premium zones, your free
			members can earn tokens for their activity and then use tokens to purchase access to premium zone.
		</li>
		<li>
			In order to allow accepting payments using different methods, signup and upgrade blocks will now allow
			displaying access packages from all active payment processors. Thus you can use multiple payment processors
			at the same time and let users decide which one to use.
		</li>
		<li>
			Members can now be awarded with tokens for logging into memberzone every specific time interval. This can
			be used to stimulate their activity on your site.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video format settings you will now be able to specify download order for each format you enable download
			option. Previously the order of download files was not defined.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video format settings you can now limit speed separately for embed code mode. This may reduce your
			traffic usage and at the same time no need to block embed codes usage.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category and tag auto-selection plugins will now support lenient match for compound tags and categories.
			This new option will provide better way for languages where word endings vary in different cases. Also will
			give flexibility in auto-selection handling.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models and content sources now support ranking based on the defined criteria (sorting). You can now display
			recent rank for each model or content source, and previous rank if changed. Ranking criteria can be set in
			content settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			In mass editing you can now submit re-creation of multiple video formats at the same time (previously it
			was only possible to do 1 at a time). Also mass editing now supports access level field.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new interface for videos / albums mass operation added: mass selection. You can use it to select list of
			videos / albums based on their IDs or URLs and then either filter them, or mass edit them, or delete them.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you use mark video / album as deleted functionality, you can now send notification email right from
			there. This functionality is typically used to handle DMCA complaints, so sending email with the list of
			deleted URLs may be useful.
		</li>
		<li>
			When editing videos or albums you can now run category, tag or model auto-selection plugins for them
			individually. Previously this was only available from mass editing GUI.
		</li>
		<li>
			Exporting feeds can now filter by HD flag. Also you can now choose to simply export 'best' or 'worst'
			quality for each video instead of specifying direct format name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin panel can now search by localized titles / descriptions / directories in all objects that support
			localization.
		</li>
		<li>
			Website UI section now features version control system, which monitors all changes in theme templates,
			styles and JS files. This will allow you to rollback any specific change at any time, or restore original
			version if you have done something wrong. It can also be used with online text compare sites to find what
			has been changed in a specific version.
		</li>
		<li>
			In website settings it will now be possible to configure that content with 'in process' or 'error'
			statuses is displayed via direct links. Previously such content would never be displayed. This feature is
			extremely useful for websites that offer video hosting functionality, users can upload their videos and
			immediately get embed codes that are not returning 404 error. Please note that you will need to update
			templates so that such cases display reasonable message, otherwise in most of the themes they will display
			no access error message.
		</li>
		<li>
			In stats settings for search stats you can now configure max query length and blacklist symbols, which will
			prevent queries that do not match these filters to be added to your stats. This is needed to prevent some
			not nice queries to be later displayed on your site.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS website engine will now be able to produce minified HTML, however this option will not be available in
			public settings and can only be enabled via <b>/admin/include/setup.php</b> configuration. HTML
			minification produces single line HTML code without line breaks, however it will result in textareas not
			functioning correctly (all multi-lined content displayed in a textarea will be wrapped, e.g. video
			description editing will wrap multi-lined description); and also if you have some inline JS / CSS code
			without ending semicolon, this will brake its syntax. Use at your own risk if needed.
		</li>
		<li>
			In website settings for dynamic HTTP parameters you can now configure their cookie lifetime. Before that
			their lifetime was forced to 365 days. These are typically used to pass affiliate refs to your site.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings it is now possible to configure access to file upload functions. Previously file upload
			function was available publicly (some sites may need anonymous upload), but now you can only allow it for
			registered members or administrators only. For remote URL uploads you can also set a max filesize limit.
		</li>
		<li>
			In this update we changed the way how tags are added in admin panel. Previously you could only mass add
			tags in plain list, but now you can mass add tags together with their synonyms; also you can use the same
			approach to add new synonyms to existing tags.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video player in admin panel editing video page will now allow switching between all video formats, if there
			are multiple. Previously it would show the biggest size format, which is not always convenient.
		</li>
		<li>
			A very important logical change for webmasters access level. Webmasters will no more have the same access
			level as premium members, they will have standard access level instead.
		</li>
		<li>
			When overload protection gets triggered for a page, KVS will return 503 status with rendering
			<b>overload.html</b> contents instead of doing redirect as before.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed the way how text search behavior works when finding only 1 result (only 1 video, 1 album and etc).
			Earlier KVS would automatically redirect to this result page by default. After the update, redirect will
			not happen by default and KVS will simply display search results page with 1 video or 1 album. If you want
			to have redirect as before, you should use <b>search_redirect_enabled</b> parameter in the corresponding
			list_xxx block in your theme.
		</li>
		<li>
			Tags list (<b>list_tags</b>) and tag cloud (<b>tags_cloud</b>) blocks now support displaying tags from any
			objects and not only from videos or albums. KVS also supports tags in models, content sources, posts,
			channels and playlists.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added a new parameter <b>show_stats</b> to video view (<b>video_view</b>) and album view (<b>album_view</b>)
			blocks. You can use this parameter to force a block make an additional query and select video or album
			views stats for the last N days. These stats can be used to show video / album popularity graph for the given
			time period (the number of days KVS keeps these stats is defined in stats settings).
		</li>
		<li>
			Categories list block (<b>list_categories</b>) can now show list of related categories, e.g. categories
			from the same group. In order to enable this the new parameters <b>var_category_id</b> /
			<b>var_category_dir</b> were added, which expect category ID or directory to be passed in URL.
		</li>
		<li>
			Search queries list block (<b>search_results</b>) can now display search queries similar to the given
			category or tag (e.g. search queries that are using this category or tag). In order to enable this the new
			parameters <b>var_category_id</b> / <b>var_category_dir</b> / <b>var_tag_id</b> / <b>var_tag_dir</b> were
			added, which expect category / tag ID or directory to be passed in URL.
		</li>
		<li>
			Posts lists block (<b>list_posts</b>) now supports filtering by custom fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			It will now be possible to display future or upcoming videos / albums. In order to do that you use the new
			<b>mode_futures</b> block parameter in <b>list_videos</b> / <b>list_albums</b> block. This option is
			extremely useful for paysites to show the upcoming updates.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Many player logic and skin fixes (described above).<br/>
			- In some cases Epoch processor would close access before the end of period.<br/>
			- Domains, that were blacklisted for signup emails would not blacklist subdomains as well.<br/>
			- Backup plugin was optimized for satellites.<br/>
			- Critical vulnerability that we've sent patch on November 20th.<br/>
			- Random video / album redirect was cached for 1 minute and redirected to the same video / album during the
			  whole minute.<br/>
			- When using external search plugin KVS would not return 404 error for non-existing pages in search
			  pagination.<br/>
			- A dozen of other small usability / stability improvements.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="section_whats_new_3_9">KVS v3.9</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_9_1">KVS v3.9.1 [08.05.2017]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Player improvements and bugfixes:<br/>
			- Better skin for touch devices and devices with small screen: some buttons are hidden, size of other
			  buttons increased.<br/>
			- Added new player skin in youtube style.<br/>
			- For iOS devices player now supports metadata preload, which will allow faster video start (if you enabled
			  the needed option in player settings and device supports this).<br/>
			- Text cue points can now be set up for timeline screenshots in video screenshots editor. Such cue points
			  will be highlighted on player timeline and texts will be shown together with screenshots. Excellent
			  feature to highlight video key scenes.<br/>
			- In pre-roll and post-roll advertising settings you can now enable built-in skip button and configure when
			  it will become active. Also GUI of such advertising was changed - you can now show message with
			  displaying advertising duration, and for video ads users can now pause and mute them.<br/>
			- Replay icon was added as a replacement for standard play button on video ending.<br/>
			- In player settings you can now specify initial player volume (and also mute player by default if needed).
			  Also we've fixed some bugs with volume slider behavior.<br/>
			- In player settings you can now configure automatic loop for short videos - you can specify the minimum
			  duration for that.<br/>
			- Some poster display issues fixed: earlier poster was not displayed before player fully initialized; also
			  it was displayed without no need if autoplay was enabled.<br/>
			- Fixed context menu issue when trying to copy embed code from the player.<br/>
			- Fixed number of issues with timeline screenshots display: their size was limited and also they could be
			  positioned incorrectly if skin was customized.<br/>
			- Display of vertical videos fixed - now they won't stretch vertically.<br/>
			- Fixed issue with caching remote servers redirects by some user agents. The new player will only allow
			  cache them for 1 hour.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			We re-thought IP limit blocking mechanism in video protection. Since we've added video file link
			obfuscation feature in 3.9.0 player, IP limit makes no much sense anymore. Now it can be switched off and
			will ease disk utilization. Also it doesn't count skipping anymore, so protection doesn't rely on how often
			user skips video. <b>ATTENTION!</b> After updating to 3.9.1 IP limit will be automatically switched off.
			You should switch it on manually in video protection settings if you still need this (for example if you
			are using 3rd party video player).
		</li>
		<li>
			Grabbers and content import improvements:<br/>
			- Added support for importing videos with multiple qualities via grabbers for those source sites that
			  support it. This can save your CPU resources on conversion, but will take more time to import new content
			  by downloading multiple files.<br/>
			- Grabbers can not import content source field for each object individually. This is not used in the
			  grabbers KVS provides, but can be used in your custom grabbers.<br/>
			- You can now skip content with duplicate titles when importing content from grabbers.<br/>
			- You can now limit description length in grabbers: either by certain number words or by symbols.<br/>
			- For some grabbers KVS can now use their delete feeds to auto-delete videos from your database. This
			  should be enabled separately for each grabber where supported.<br/>
			- When importing embed codes or pseudo-videos from grabbers, you can now specify URL postfix with your ref
			  code to make URLs of all embed codes / pseudo-videos have it.<br/>
			- KVS grabbers plugin will now support youtube-dl server library, which implements parsing for many tube
			  sites. This will help us to add grabbers faster in future.<br/>
			- Import functionality was enhanced with ability to skip content which files failed to be downloaded for
			  whatever reason. Earlier such content would be imported in KVS and then would be moved to error status
			  during conversion phase. This didn't allow try importing it once again because of duplicates check.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			In timeline screenshots settings you can now configure the desired number of screenshots instead of their
			interval. Based on that the interval can vary depending on video duration. On the one hand this will make
			navigation in video not so accurate, on the other hand this will prevent creating 200-500 images for long
			videos. The key aspect here is that interval will never be less than 10 seconds and any other intervals
			will be divisible by 10. For example if you configure the number of timelines to be 100, for short videos
			KVS will create timelines with 10 seconds interval - their number will depend on video duration. For videos
			longer than 10*100=1000 seconds KVS will choose 20 seconds interval and etc. If you already use timeline
			screenshots you can easily switch to the new approach in video format settings, this will affect new videos
			and old videos will continue showing timelines using the old way.
		</li>
		<li>
			Due to the changes in timelines creation logic and for supporting future changes in this area, starting
			from 3.9.1 KVS will automatically update API for all conversion servers during update procedure. You should
			understand here that any custom changes you've put into <b>remote_cron.php</b> will be vanished. KVS will
			try to do a backup copy of this file and to put it near by. Conversion engine will not use conversion
			servers with obsolete API version anymore.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added integration with MPA3 script.
		</li>
		<li>
			The execution order of background tasks was changed a bit. Earlier when you had many secondary background
			tasks, the new content wouldn't be processed until other tasks are completed or until you manually increase
			priority for new content tasks. This won't be needed anymore, since KVS will automatically put new content
			tasks in the front of execution queue even if all tasks have the same priority. Moreover you can now
			configure default priority for content tasks submitted by different types of users: standard, trusted,
			premium, webmasters. Also you can now manually increase conversion priority for videos and albums from
			their listings - earlier this was only possible from the tasks listing.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally we've added ability to mark content as removed. You can now do that for any set of videos / albums
			and specify the reason. All files of this content will be deleted including video files, screenshots and
			formats, but the data will remain in database. This content will disappear from public lists and will only
			remain available via direct URLs with displaying all the info, comments and delete reason. For correct
			rendering you should modify templates, please check our forum for instructions.
		</li>
		<li>
			User account generation plugin added in 3.9.0 can now generate access codes instead of user accounts.
			Access codes can be used on sign up and upgrade flows to get tokens or premium level. You can sell these
			codes via external online shops as an alternative to KVS billing solution. Access codes are more convenient
			than pre-generated accounts, since they can be used by existing users while keeping existing profiles, also
			users can use multiple access codes for refills / rebills.
		</li>
		<li>
			For hotlinked videos it is now possible to re-create screenshots. In order to do that KVS will download
			hotlinked video again to create screenshots.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is now possible to award users with tokens for sending traffic to their videos or albums to your site
			(embed codes do not support this). You can specify the number of tokens that should be awarded for each N
			unique views (only IPs unique within 24 hours are counted here). When calculating awards KVS will pay
			tokens for those videos and albums that get the needed number of views. You can use this functionality to
			get more external links to your project if your users will be interested in earning tokens. If needed you
			can pay out tokens with real money using KVS payout solution.
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS 3.9.1 provides new features in restricting access to videos and albums. It is now possible to configure
			access level for public videos and albums (previously you could only do that for private and premium). Also
			you can now configure access level for each video or album individually, which will override access level
			inherited from type field. This new feature can be used to workaround KVS architecture issue that doesn't
			allow changing video from public to premium type and vice versa. Now if you want to make any public video
			available for premium members only or by tokens purchase, you can do that without changing its type.
		</li>
		<li>
			Enhanced rendering of screenshots and album photos in admin panel, they will be adaptive now. Also added
			red highlights for fields which triggered validation errors when saving editors.
		</li>
		<li>
			In main video editor you can now delete screenshots as well if they are enabled for display there.
			Previously you could only change main screenshot.
		</li>
		<li>
			Set of import / export enhancements and bugfixes:<br/>
			- You can now filter export data by reviewed flag.<br/>
			- You can now export video source files for those videos that keep them.<br/>
			- It is now possible to export rating in percents (0-100%) and also import / export will support the
			  number of votes for rating.<br/>
			- Fixed bug with importing / exporting models with commas in their names.<br/>
			- Fixed bug with incorrect sorting by rating.<br/>
			- Optimized memory usage in export.<br/>
			- Exporting feeds now support filtering by query string. In order to allow this feature you should enable
			  it in feed settings, since it can affect database performance if frequently used.<br/>
			- Fixed a bug in exporting feeds which could lead to wrong size in embed codes for some types of videos.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Model auto-selection plugin will now be looking into content tags as well. Previously it was only looking
			into title and description.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now sort models manually like categories in order to force specific sorting when displaying on
			site.
		</li>
		<li>
			In models list block (<b>list_models</b>) it is now possible to display similar models using a big variety
			of criteria: by country, by city, by age, by sex, by height, by weight, by eye or hair color and so on.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video upload block (<b>video_edit</b>) you can now configure that uploaded files are considered as files
			of specific format to skip their conversion. This feature is not need in most cases, it was implemented for
			specific requirements when your project is designed to provide an upload gateway for known users who will
			correctly upload files in the needed format. This can also be used to create a separate upload page for
			webmasters to allow them upload videos faster without the need to process them.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video, album and playlist editing blocks (<b>video_edit</b>, <b>album_edit</b>, <b>playlist_edit</b>)
			the new option added that allows you to configure content deactivation after it was modified. In older KVS
			versions there was only one option (<b>force_inactive</b>) that affected both new content and modified
			content. If it was enabled, any modified video or album would become deactivated until you manually
			activate it back. Now this won't happen. After the update the new option (<b>force_inactive_on_edit</b>)
			will be switched off, so any modified content will remain active. If you want to force the old behavior,
			you should modify settings of these blocks and switch the new option on.
		</li>
		<li>
			In global stats block (<b>global_stats</b>) you can now render how many people visited your site yesterday,
			last week and last month from KVS stats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Flagging content will now store additional info about initiator: IP, country, user agent and page URL.
		</li>
		<li>
			On conversations list (<b>mode_conversations</b> mode in <b>list_members</b> block) you can now implement
			removal functionality to completely delete multiple conversations. Also for each conversation in the list
			it is now possible to display last message from it.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is now possible to display video duration in standard format HH:MM:SS. Historically KVS displayed it in
			MM:SS format, which could show 3 digit number for long videos: MMM:SS. In order to use the new format you
			should modify site templates, which is described on KVS forum.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- During content import there could be a case when all import lines triggered validation errors, so even in
			  that case KVS would allow submitting this import with empty list of valid lines.<br/>
			- Redirecting to random video / album didn't consider some satellite settings.<br/>
			- Non critical XSS vulnerability when using dynamic HTTP parameters from site settings. Thanks to
			  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-uwais/" target="_blank">Muhammad Uwais</a> for kindly
			  pointing it out.<br/>
			- When detecting SAR of source video file in some cases KVS would absolutely redundantly reconvert it for
			  normalization. This was fixed, as well as normalization method was optimized for faster time and avoid
			  quality loss.<br/>
			- Search function could lead to empty search if using stop words (in case of searching for the whole stop
			  word) and KVS would show all videos / albums for such empty search.<br/>
			- Some cURL operations worked incorrectly if open_basedir option was enabled in PHP configuration.<br/>

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_9_0">KVS v3.9.0 [24.11.2016]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The completely new HTML5 player fully replaces the old Flash-based player KVS used to have. In the new
			player, HTML5 is the primary mode. The Flash component is activated only when the current video cannot be
			played in the user's browser using HTML5. Usually these are pre-IE9 browsers, or when it's a FLV video. We
			did what we could to keep the player's interface intact. We also tried our best to keep the old features
			and add new ones.
		</li>
		<li>
			New player features:<br/>
			- Full player skin control via CSS3. You can now add custom skins.<br/>
			- Video metadata preloading is now available (except mobile phones). It makes your MP4 files start to play
			  faster.<br/>
			- The format switch is now an icon. You can add HD indication to let people know HD formats are available.<br/>
			- Popunder support added. It works not by opening a new browser window, something that is often blocked by
			  browser plugins, but via opening an ad page in the original page of your site. At the same time, the
			  player page is opened as a new browser window, and video playback starts automatically. This will
			  increase server load, but will also increase popunder ad conversion ratio.<br/>
			- Related videos as HTML are now supported, with customisable layout. For this new feature to work, you
			  need to modify site templates. These are not activated automatically when you update your copy of KVS. We
			  will add more info on this in the FAQ.<br/>
			- Timeline screenshots are now sent to the player in an optimised way. This lets the system make less
			  Apache requests and decrease server load.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Old player features that are no longer supported:<br/>
			- Placing the logo as a stripe in the bottom or at the top. These do not function properly on some devices.<br/>
			- Skipping in FLV files: we no longer recommend using FLV; use MP4 instead.<br/>
			- Ads displayed on mouse over: makes no sense for mobile devices.<br/>
			- Old player JavaScript API that used certain functions with predefined names. This may result in your
			  customised player features no longer working properly. You will need to rewrite your customisation using
			  the new API. It will be described in the FAQ.<br/>
			- Integration with the teasernet network. It is about to be replaced with VAST support in future.<br/>
			- Any embed codes via Flash will no longer work.<br/>
			- If you replaced KVS player with JW player, it will stop showing timeline screenshots.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			New type of anti-hotlink protection: IP-based protection with 100% hotlinking impossibility guarantee. This
			protection feature also does not let users share direct links to video files. Links will only work for the
			IP they have been made available to. A disadvantage here is that you yourself will not be able to hotlink
			your videos on other sites. If you already hotlink your videos on other sites, you will not be able to use
			this protection. Old referrer-based protection is still around, but it does not show great reliability.
			After the update, the protection will keep working the old way. To switch to the new type, you need to go
			to Content Settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now enable player link encryption. This can protect you from third party content grabbers with
			almost a 100% chance. However, this protection will not cover download links if you allow video downloads
			for your users. These links do not use the player and therefore cannot be encrypted. Go to Content Settings
			to enable your player links encryption.
		</li>
		<li>
			Videos now have the HD flag that is added automatically when the video has HD files. Due to this you can
			display a HD indicator in video lists as well as filter only HD or non-HD videos. After the update, your
			system will launch a background task to set this flag for all videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now enable stat logging for categories and tags in the video rotator. This lets a video have
			different CTRs in different categories (tags). This way, the rotation will be more efficient. Currently
			this is not available for screenshots. Most likely, we will add support for different best-performing
			screenshots in different categories (tags) in upcoming product versions, along with other rotator
			improvements.
		</li>
		<li>
			When rotation is enabled, you can now go to video editor and see rotation summary for this particular video,
			including impressions, clicks, overall CTR and ranking, as well as CTR for each category (tag).
		</li>
		<li>
			We moved the ZIP archive and source photo access settings to the list of album formats as a standalone
			pseudo format. Now, for source files of albums, you can assign an image that will be shown instead of a
			photo if the user has not been granted access to it. Also, you can delete ZIP files of source photos if you
			don't need them anymore.
		</li>
		<li>
			We added a plugin generating users with premium membership of predefined duration in days or tokens. The
			output will be a list of login:password pairs, and you can market these as digital goods in online shops.
			This can be used as an alternative to payment processing services when you sell premium memberships.
		</li>
		<li>
			Custom content post-processing plugin has been added. With it, you can easily add custom logic to video or
			album processing without having to modify the core engine. This plugin does not install automatically after
			you update your copy of KVS. Contact us if you would like to use it.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the synonymizer plugin, you can apply a filter to the content being processed. Now, you can configure
			the synonymizer in such a way that it would be enabled only for videos from feeds or from grabbers while
			other videos will be ignored.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the import feed list, mass activation and deactivation are now supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			The way stats are sent via JavaScript has been optimised. Now there are 20-30% less Apache requests. For
			this update to work, you need to manually update the theme's JS files. For the new theme, it's main.min.js.
			For the old theme, please contact tech support about any updates.
		</li>
		<li>
			For SEO satellites, you can set up a selection of default item titles along with satellite-specific titles.
		</li>
		<li>
			In post list (<b>list_posts</b>) and post viewing (<b>post_view</b>) blocks, you can now display
			information about the video attached to the post.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_videos</b> and the <b>list_albums</b> blocks, you can now filter the list using any range of
			publishing date, e.g. videos for January, for February etc. This is based on the <b>var_post_date_from</b>
			and <b>var_post_date_to</b> parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the member list block (<b>list_members</b>), several new modes have been added: a) users the current
			user is subscribed to, b) subscribers of the current user, c) friend requests for the current user. Also,
			several new actions have been added: bulk unsubscribe from selected users, and bulk friend request
			confirmation.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the member information block (<b>member_profile_view</b>), you now can display data that shows whether
			this user has been blocked by the current user, or vice versa, whether the current user has been blocked by
			them. Moreover, this block now supports unblocking action.
		</li>
		<li>
			In model list (<b>list_models</b>) you can now filter models by city name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- In certain cases, grabbers would create duplicate videos.<br/>
			- In the rotator weighing matrix view plugin, global blocks information would not be displayed.<br/>
			- In the signup block, sometimes user-uploaded avatars would not be saved.<br/>
			- When uploading source video files over 4Gb in size, their original size would not be stored in the
			  database correctly.<br/>
			- On some operating systems multi-threaded import would not work correctly.<br/>
			- In the category avatar generation plugin, resize logic was changed to avoid black bars on category
			  thumbs.<br/>

	<h2 id="section_whats_new_3_8">KVS v3.8</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_8_5">KVS v3.8.5 [04.08.2016]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Video and photo content grabber plugin was added, together with several grabbers for popular tube sites.
			Each grabber can obtain the fullest possible range of content attributes from the site that are supported
			by KVS (categories, models, tags, ratings, views, upload date). In grabber settings, you can select which
			attributes should be copied. Also, you can choose the content submission type: download, embed code, or
			pseudo-video. With downloads, you will also be able to choose the best format (720p, 480p etc), if the
			source site supports multiple quality formats. In addition to grabbers built for specific sites, KVS also
			supports default photo and video grabbers that are able to locate content on virtually any site, provided
			links to photos and videos are openly available in the page's HTML code. These grabbers have limited
			functionality: they can only detect title, description, and the content item itself, as they are not
			designed to understand any specific HTML structure. Similar grabbing features have been previously used in
			KVS for FHG imports. Now, these have been completely replaced with grabbers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Almost all grabbers can process not just individual pages with content, but content lists split into pages.
			For instance, you want to add 1,000 top rated videos from a site. Now, all you need to do is specify the
			link to the first page of that list and the number 1,000. KVS will go page to page until 1,000 links have
			been processed. In the grabber plugin, there is a simplified import interface. There, you can add links to
			individual content items as well as to various content lists together with number of items. Now you can add
			tens of thousands of content items to KVS in a very easy way. You can specify any lists, categories, search
			results, any kind of sorting. Just copy the list URL from your browser. If the grabber supports lists, it
			will add the amount of content you want to add using your criteria.
		</li>
		<li>
			The grabber plugin also has the autopilot feature. You can configure it for each grabber separately. All
			the things you can do in manual import mode, you can set up in the autopilot mode. You can use the manual
			import to import the initial content database and then feed the same lists to the autopilot so that it adds
			new content that shows up in these lists later.
		</li>
		<li>
			Grabbers are still in beta for now, so we hope for your patience and understanding. The grabber plugin
			supports automated grabber updates from our repository. You can also use new grabbers without updating your
			version of KVS. That's right, you can use newly released grabbers right after we add them. Please get in
			touch with the support department if you want us to add new grabbers or if you want us to add a grabber for
			your site. This could help you distribute your embed codes from other KVS users. We will not add grabbers
			for KVS-based sites unless the site owner contacts us.
		</li>
		<li>
			Background content import system has been fully revamped. Earlier, each import launched a background
			process. It could crash because of an error related to the cURL library in the operating system. Now,
			import-related background processes are launched differently. KVS monitors each process and relaunches the
			ones that crash automatically. Moreover, in import settings, you can set up the number of processes, thus
			configuring parallel import with just a single click. In previous versions, you would need to launch
			several import processes manually if you wanted them to work simultaneously.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now check the admin area for details on all imports, including active and completed ones. For each
			import, you can see the data imported. You can also launch an import with the same parameters in just one
			click.
		</li>
		<li>
			PayPal have been added as payment processors with support for tokens and trial access.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now users can send tokens to other users as a gift. This feature can be used as a 'donate' contribution
			sent by visitors to support uploaders.
		</li>
		<li>
			In stop words, you can now use masks with *. This lets you add words with partial match.
		</li>
		<li>
			In personal admin settings, you can now configure the way scheduler dates are displayed on the start page
			as well as choose whether to show latest or upcoming dates.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category and model selectors in the admin panel no longer display synonyms when selected. Only names of
			categories and models are displayed. This also let us activate search through synonyms in the tag selector.
		</li>
		<li>
			When checking new content, you now have protection against accidents when using the 'also delete other
			non-approved videos / albums from this user' option. Now this can be applied to 30 videos / albums max as
			in certain situations it can delete the entire content database if it was imported with the 'needs
			approval' flag. If you would like to increase this limit, please contact the support department.
		</li>
		<li>
			Export feeds now have the <b>skip</b> parameter that lets you skip N videos from the start of the feed.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site settings you can now configure whether disabled content is available via direct URLs or not.
			Earlier disabled content was always available via direct URLs. Now you can enable it to return 404 errors.
			<b>ATTENTION!</b> This behavior is now set by default in all new KVS installations.
		</li>
		<li>
			In feedback messages, more metadata is now saved, including user browser and device as well as the URL from
			which the feedback form was opened.
		</li>
		<li>
			The token flow block (<b>list_members_tokens</b>) now supports filtering by payouts. A user can now see the
			list of payouts that have been made, and display awards for each payout. This feature also lets you show
			awards that have not yet been paid out.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_members</b> (list of members) block, you can now apply filters by all custom user fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_models</b> (list of models) and <b>list_content_sources</b> (list of content sources), you
			can now use sorting by screenshots. It lets you display objects with uploaded screenshots first.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- In new ffmpeg versions, SAR of the source file would not be detected correctly.<br/>
			- When deleting content purchased by a user in the admin panel, the purchase would not be reset.<br/>
			- An issue with saving import schemes could lead to saved schemes being overwritten or modified.<br/>
			- An issue in ccbill denial processing.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_8_4">KVS v3.8.4 [15.05.2016]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			KVS users can now receive payouts of the tokens they have earned. Tokens are earned via selling content or
			as rewards for certain types of activity.
		</li>
		<li>
			New block called <b>list_members_tokens</b> has been added. It lets you display token movements for a user
			account, including how many tokens were purchased, how many were earned and spent, and how many were paid
			out. The block features date and record type filtering.
		</li>
		<li>
			When videos and albums purchased by other users are deleted, they will be deactivated instead from now on.
			Also, lists of purchased videos and albums will include inactive content as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			Member area award log has been moved to the stats section.
		</li>
		<li>
			Creating conversion servers is now easier. Now, the <b>remote_cron.php</b> file will be copied
			automatically so that your new conversion server activates as soon as you enable cron. For local conversion
			servers, you do not need to set up cron manually anymore. KVS will do it for you.
		</li>
		<li>
			In albums, you can now manage the preview image uploading or replacing it at any time. Previously, you
			could only upload it when creating the album. Preview images are used to create preview group formats used
			in album lists.
		</li>
		<li>
			Watermark images for videos are now customizable via custom PHP logic.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can manage theme language files via the admin panel. You can manage either entire text files, or
			separate entries.
		</li>
		<li>
			In new KVS installations, we added a separate theme settings page. It lets you quickly set up main theme
			options as well as see details regarding basic feature settings (comments, content uploading, registration,
			logging in). We hope this page will help you get started faster and set up basic parameters right away
			instead of going deep and exploring all the many settings and options.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category and model selectors in the admin panel now support showing synonyms and searching by them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content serving monitoring can now check formats that are only available to registered users.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support for built-in special character transliteration for main European languages when generating
			directories has been added. Before, you would need to set up transliteration rules manually when enabling
			transliteration. Now you can leave the rules empty so that default ones are applied.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video formats you can now limit speed for certain countries only. You can use this feature to restrict
			access to all your videos for specific countries and at the same time have the site fully functional.
		</li>
		<li>
			In mass video editing, you can now mass replace selected video format to a file you upload. Replacing video
			files with a placeholder video can be used as a way to not fully delete a video if a DMCA request is
			received. In this case, the video page will remain active, but the users will see the placeholder video.
			KVS has a plugin for creating placeholder videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and album import, you can now use file paths instead of links. For example, all content is on your
			server. Before, in order to import it, you would need to use web links to the files. Now you can use file
			paths as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			Background mass edit tasks can now be seen in background task list.
		</li>
		<li>
			In album format settings, you can now disable cropping for certain formats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Features have been added making checking for spam faster when new videos and albums uploaded from the site
			are checked. Now, you can remove videos or albums right away and set up additional anti-spam actions, e.g.
			block user, block user IP or IP mask, block email domain, delete all other new videos or albums from this
			user. In addition to this, you can now manage the IP, IP mask, and email blacklist in member zone settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site debugger, text data from language files is now available.
		</li>
		<li>
			In NATS processing settings, you can now use trial memberships as non-premium KVS users. This lets you set
			up custom limits for trial users. You can also set up assigning tokens to trial users so that you can limit
			the amount of content they have access to. In this case, trial members will only be able to see the content
			they paid for with tokens.
		</li>
		<li>
			In player settings, when adblock protection is enabled, you can now use the <b>%POSTER_URL%</b> that is
			replaced by the video poster.
		</li>
		<li>
			In FTP upload plugin, you can now set content status after it's processed. Previously all imported content
			would be added as inactive.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content export, you can now filter content via admin owner.

		<li>
			In video upload block, you can now upload videos as embed codes. This is enabled in <b>video_edit</b> block
			settings and is disabled by default. You can also set up a list of allowed domains for embed codes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b>, you can now set up the way the search behaves when nothing is
			found. By default, the blocks would show empty lists. You can use new parameters to set up showing error
			404 or using a 302 redirect to another page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Updated theme includes support for German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Chinese, and
			Japanese.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- When multiple feeds were processing the same source, sometimes duplicates would appear.<br/>
			- When a user was deleted from the database, they were not logged out. If the user was logged in at the
			  time, the session would remain active.<br/>
			- In player HTML ads, special characters would sometimes not be displayed correctly.<br/>
			- When launching tasks to create optionally required video formats on the primary server, garbage files
			  would accumulate.<br/>
			- When a lot of tasks of certain types were active, task priority would not function.<br/>
			- When clicking the save and next button, sometimes an object would be skipped.<br/>
			- Content owner could not have access to files of their content.<br/>
			- Import feed would not support embed codes in the smartscripts format.

		<li>
			Emergency update in order to neutralize ffmpeg library security issue in HLS format handling. For most
			security it is advised to rebuild ffmpeg with the following options:
			<span class="code">
			--disable-demuxer='hls,applehttp'
			--disable-network

	<ul>
		<li>
			In the admin panel, all lists in posts, memberzone and channels / series have been reworked. Now you can
			select columns to be displayed, and filter sets have been improved as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			In posts in the side menu of the administration panel, you can now see individual lists for posts of
			different types. Each list can be configured in its own way. For this update to take effect, you need to
			add this rule to your <b>/admin/.htaccess</b> file:
			<span class="code">
			RewriteRule ^posts_for_(.*)\.php$ posts_for_types.php?post_type_external_id=$1 [L,QSA]
			</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of object search in the admin panel is now different. Most lists now let you choose which of
			their data fields to search through.
		</li>
		<li>
			pay2pay.com payment aggregator is now supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import feeds, you can now disable adding videos with titles that already exist. Also, for every feed,
			you can now allow adding videos that have been previously added and then were deleted. Before, import feeds
			would never let you re-add videos that have been deleted. This had to be solved by changing the prefix of
			the duplicates.
		</li>
		<li>
			Data migration plugin was added. It helps you connect migrator scripts to move data from other sites to
			KVS. Also, you can use to migrate categorization from other KVS sites to your copy of KVS. You could not
			do that before. We have already built migrator scripts for a few of other content management systems. If
			you have sites powered by scripts that are no longer maintained and supported, we can easily add a migrator
			for your script type and thus let you move your content to a KVS site.
		</li>
		<li>
			We changed the way KVS packages work. Now, when you are using basic KVS packages, you see fully functional
			filler blocks instead of the blocks that are missing. With new themes, it will let you use their templates
			without removing the features not supported by your KVS package. You can just disable the features in theme
			settings. Thus, when you upgrade to a more advanced KVS package, you will have all the features without
			having to make adjustments.
		</li>
		<li>
			Player ad features have been improved. Now, the system stores impression and click stats for all HTML
			player ads. Also, you can configure background color for HTML ads. Before, it used to be black only. You
			can also make the size of the ad adjust itself to the size of the player (responsive ads).
		</li>
		<li>
			In player settings, you can now disallow showing the player to users with Adblock enabled. You can show a
			static HTML code instead, asking users to disable the plugin. Please note that certain 3rd party ad
			providers (exoclick etc) can be blocked automatically if the ad code contains a link to their site. We
			recommend that you check this yourself and contact your ad providers for the most updated ad codes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In embed player settings, you can now configure a separate template for situations when a video is being
			processed or has been deleted. Previously, in this situation the embed code would always return error 404.
		</li>
		<li>
			Groups of channels (TV series) now support extra fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the admin panel, you can now sort videos in playlists, episodes in seasons, and seasons in TV series
			manually.
		</li>
		<li>
			For playlists, you can now configure the playlist page pattern on the site.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and album export, you can now export ZIP archives for those screenshot and album formats for which
			creation of them is enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the audit plugin, there are new content check features: in videos, you can now check whether the embed
			codes are working (only for codes that return the 404 error) and hotlinked files. Also, you can now check
			whether all files of other objects (posts, categorization, users) exist.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the backup plugin, you can now disable content backups when automated backups are created.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site page performance monitoring, information on memory used to generate a page is now collected.
		</li>
		<li>
			In KVS admin settings, you can now limit their access to inactive content only.
		</li>
		<li>
			In billing, manual transactions now can have descriptions.
		</li>
		<li>
			In feedback, users now can enter message subject that will be used as subject in the email response.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video view (<b>video_view</b>) and album view blocks (<b>album_view</b>), you now have the administrator
			flag value.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content source (<b>content_source_view</b>), model (<b>model_view</b>) and channel or season of a TV series
			(<b>dvd_view</b>) view blocks now check whether the directory is valid and redirect users to a corrected
			link if directory is invalid. Also, in these blocks you now have parameters that let you display next and
			previous items.
		</li>
		<li>
			In category list (<b>list_categories</b>) and model list (<b>list_models</b>) blocks, you can now use
			parameters that let you enable display video and album duplicates if such selection is enabled for each
			category or model element. Previously, duplicates would always be excluded, which sometimes led to empty
			lists of related videos or albums for some list elements.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the playlist list block (<b>list_playlists</b>), you can now display playlists 'related' to the current
			video. Essentially, it's a list of playlists where this video is included.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the user subscription list (<b>list_members_subscriptions</b>), you can now filter the list items by
			subscription type: content providers, users etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site debugger, you can now also see the variables with empty values. Previously, they would not be
			shown.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- The maximum video duration limit of 4 hours was removed.<br/>
			- In video export and export feeds, in the description field, line breaks are replaced with spaces.<br/>
			- After version 3.8.1, the backup plugin stopped deleting old copies.<br/>
			- In import feeds, a video with empty categories would sometimes receive the categories of the previous
			  video.<br/>
			- After the format file was re-created or uploaded, video duration would sometimes not update.<br/>
			- Uploading files via link would not work with some wget library bundles.<br/>
			- In stats, links to detailed referrer stats would sometimes work incorrectly.<br/>
			- In posts, date of last view would not refresh.<br/>
			- The conversion engine stopped returning an error when a video format with specified duration limits could
			  not be created. Now, it creates a format with maximum duration allowed.<br/>
			- False audit plugin errors would be returned if the CDN management script returned links without
			  specifying protocol. <br/>
			- Command+S would not work for saving forms in Mac OS.<br/>
			- In the player, when auto-playback was on, the control panel would not hide until you moved the mouse
			  over it.<br/>
			- In full text search through videos and albums, search through extra fields would not work.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_8_1">KVS v3.8.1 [10.08.2015]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Paid voting for flags added. Now, for each flag, you can set up and amount in tokens that users need to
			spend to use these flags to vote for a video, album, or other items.
		</li>
		<li>
			5 more extra text fields added for tags. Please note that when you merge several tags via renaming the
			content in extra fields of one of the tags may be lost.
		</li>
		<li>
			Internal messaging revamped. Now you can display a list of users that the current user has conversations
			with (enabled by the <b>mode_conversations</b> parameter of the <b>list_members</b> block). In this list,
			you can also display total number of messages with each user as well as total unread messages. Any users
			can be ignored now and messages from them will not be shown. Also, you can make internal messaging paid so
			that users need to spend tokens to send a message to another user.
		</li>
		<li>
			In remote storage and conversion server settings, you can now set a custom FTP timeout. Also the system was
			optimized so that it creates less FTP connections.
		</li>
		<li>
			This version puts a start to our full and gradual usability update for the admin area interface. So far the
			changes mostly concern categorization. There, in all lists, you can now check the columns you want to be
			displayed. Filters were improved as well: the new data filter lets you filter items with any empty or
			non-empty field. In new versions, we will add a similar filtering system and customizable columns to all
			lists.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, you can now customize a RAM limit for background system processes such as content
			processing, importing, or feeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, a new option lets you disallow adding videos with source file duplicates. This feature
			can include not only existing videos but deleted ones as well. Please note this feature will be only be
			applied to new content that was added after the update.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, new options let you disallow adding videos (albums or posts) with name duplicates.
			These options only affect the admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Approving new content in video and album lists became much easier. Now by activating content you remove the
			'pending approval' flag. Previously you had to remove this flag for each item separately. Also, in bulk
			actions, you can now bulk activate selected items while deleting other inactive items, as well as delete
			selected items while activating other non-activated items. Just like with comments, but now, inactive items
			are deleted not from the entire database, but from the items you currently see in the list.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the user list, fast login under any user is now possible.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video script protection settings, you can now add a white list of domains on which hotlinking to your
			video files is allowed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now video channels are selected using predictive text input instead of a dropdown menu.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import feeds, you can now specify the channel in CSV settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			Backup plugin improvements. First, a copy of embed player settings is now created via a separate option
			instead of being created together with a copy of site design. Often copies of site design are used to
			duplicate the design across different sites, and there, embed player settings are redundant. Also, you can
			now backup the files of auxiliary content not directly related to videos or albums (posts, categories,
			user avatars etc).
		</li>
		<li>
			The avatar generation plugin will not re-generate avatars for categories where the avatars have not been
			changed since last generation. This is to optimize server load.
		</li>
		<li>
			The automated cache cleaning plugin now detects maximum age of cached files to delete them when this age is
			reached. Previously, files older than 5 days would always be deleted. This lets you have less garbage
			cache.
		</li>
		<li>
			Verotel payment processor is now supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			In scripts that redirect to random video or album, you can now send the category using its ID or directory.
			Also, any additional parameters sent by this script will be added to the redirect.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b>, the <b>skip_with_admin_flag</b> parameter was added. It lets
			you exclude content with a certain admin flag from the block.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b>, you can now use filtering by user without enabling the
			<b>mode_uploaded</b> mode.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Image viewing would not work in the admin panel when extensions of uploaded files were in uppercase.<br/>
			- In import feed settings, selected extra fields would be displayed with blank names.<br/>
			- In the <b>post_view</b> block, the <b>show_next_and_prev_info</b> parameter would not be limited to the
			  type of current post.<br/>
			- In video import feeds, a non-empty directory would be created for a video with a blank name.<br/>
			- In the site video upload block, release year could not be specified.<br/>
			- When moving content to a different group of storage servers, tasks would be completed with errors when
			  files on the hard drive were replaced manually.<br/>
			- An attempt to restore the password right after registration made it impossible to activate the profile
			  using the link provided.<br/>
			- In some cases when background processing tasks for new videos were relaunched the tasks could not be
			  executed once again.<br/>
			- When KVS could not connect to storage servers often, many garbage folders would be created on conversion
			  servers.<br/>
			- In folders of remote storage or conversion servers sometimes lots of text files called test-[number].dat
			  would be created.<br/>
			- Site debugger would keep redirecting to site index with a certain block configuration on the page.<br/>
			- Certain logical fixes in the way NATS and EPOCH payment processors interact with the system.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_8_0">KVS v3.8.0 [01.05.2015]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Channels and groups of channels can now be officially labeled as series, which makes working with them
			easier. To do that, set the <b>dvds_mode</b> in <b>/admin/include/setup.php</b> to <b>series</b>. It will
			let you add seasons right as you are creating or editing a series. You will also be able to add episodes to
			seasons in season editor.
		</li>
		<li>
			DVDs and channels and groups of them now support full categorization: categories, tags, and models. The
			same is true for series and seasons of series.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models and content sources now support partial categorization: tags and categories. When you import
			content, you can configure importing in such a way that model categories are added to the content, just
			like it was for content sources earlier.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now connect screenshot and album crop settings to extra fields of content sources. Thus you can use
			different crop settings for content from different sources (e.g. crop the watermark on the images).
		</li>
		<li>
			In screenshot and album format settings, you can now enable creating of images with progressive loading as
			well as adding a comment (copyright) to be stored in the metadata.
		</li>
		<li>
			In lists, mass content filtration options have been extended. This lets you filter out virtually any
			content on your site using extra flags. Flag values are set via cron using your custom logic. The site
			filters out content by checking the flag value. This is particularly useful on satellite sites when several
			sites display content from the same database and some sites display only some content. This filtration is
			easy to configure, and it is exceptionally fast compared to features available earlier.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import and import feeds, you can now set a word or character limit in the title. Everything else will be
			discarded.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, you can now set criteria that allow background tasks to be launched: max server LA and
			time interval in days. Thus you can have your server launch background tasks only when the load is minimal.
		</li>
		<li>
			In player settings, you can now enable automatic scaling of imported embed codes to your desired size. This
			lets you import embed codes of any size, and they will be automatically stretched to fit your design.
		</li>
		<li>
			In member area settings, you can now let users set the price of the videos and albums they upload. Prices
			are set in tokens. When other users purchase access to these videos or albums, owners will get a share of
			the price in tokens. Thus you can encourage your content uploaders to participate in your affiliate
			program.
		</li>
		<li>
			Database check is now optimized so that checks do not generate any load.
		</li>
		<li>
			The engine now downloads files in a better way. First, when a file is downloaded, its actual size is
			compared with the size in the headers, and if there is a mismatch, the file is re-downloaded. Second,
			instead of local downloads (from the same domain), file system copying is used, which results in much
			faster processing.
		</li>
		<li>
			Import feeds can now be launched every minute. Before, they could only be launched once an hour.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and album import, you can now import data when some of the links to screenshots or photos are
			broken. In this case, then import checks are run, warnings about partially unavailable files are shown
			(unless checks are disabled). The same goes for video importing feeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import and import feeds, you can disallow creating new categories, models and content sources basing on
			import data. It can be useful when the data you are importing contains unnecessary categorization you do
			not want to import.
		</li>
		<li>
			Export feeds can now generate output of content that has not been published yet.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now connect posts to videos. You can use this feature to display additional text content related to
			your videos, e.g. film reviews.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and album lists in the admin panel, you can now enable display of admin flag.
		</li>
		<li>
			In mass video and album editing, you can now assign a random content administrator from a list.
		</li>
		<li>
			In embed codes, you can now set autorun and player skin via embed code parameters. Embed codes with
			assigned parameters can be obtained through video export and from export feeds. For this fix to work, you
			need to modify your embed code template. Contact our support for that.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the backup plugin, weekly backup was moved from Sunday to Monday.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the audit log analysis plugin, past month period was added according to its start and end dates.
		</li>
		<li>
			When you respond to a feedback message, message topic is preserved and original message is quoted.
		</li>
		<li>
			After the user is deleted, all their comments are displayed as anonymous instead of being deleted.
		</li>
		<li>
			The way user friend list is displayed has been optimized considerably.
		</li>
		<li>
			In registration block, you can now disable the captcha.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_dvd_groups</b> and <b>list_dvds</b> blocks, which are also used to display series and seasons of
			series, you can now search and filter by alphabet.
		</li>
		<li>
			In various categorization and list blocks, a few new parameters were added to improve filtering. In models,
			you can now filter by country, hair color, and eye color.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video and album lists can now be sorted by their extra field values.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Security checks allowed administrators to replace screenshots through manual grabbing without having
			  access to specific videos.<br/>
			- If var_from was not enabled in <b>list_videos</b> / <b>list_albums</b> blocks that displayed search
			  results, number of search results would not be saved for search queries.<br/>
			- Storage server check used last added content (video or album) and with CDN could return errors as the
			  content would not have been fully uploaded to CDN.<br/>
			- When vertical videos were uploaded using the new theme, the preview screenshot would not be rotated.<br/>
			- Pagination with pseudo-random sorting resulted in empty list.<br/>
			- In new embed codes, affiliate refs would not be sent to video page.<br/>
			- In import feeds, when premium videos were imported, format was not taken into account when selected.<br/>
			- In import feeds, setting server time for imported video would work slightly incorrectly.<br/>
			- In <b>list_videos</b>, when external search plugin was used, <b>show_xxx_info</b> options would not
			  work.<br/>
			- Fixes in gallery grabber.

	<ul>
		<li>
			Playlists now have a lot more features. You can now fully manage your playlists from the admin panel.
			Site-side, <b>playlist_view</b> and <b>playlist_coments</b> blocks have been added. These let you fully use
			playlist view pages on your site, with ratings, flags, popularity and comments. Playlists now feature tag
			and category support. Users can also subscribe to playlists.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site settings, premium and private video access settings have been added. Previously, private videos
			were available only to the friends of a user while premium videos were available to all users (assuming
			only premium users can see 'full' formats of premium videos). Now you can configure this. For example, you
			can make private videos available to all logged in users, not just friends.
		</li>
		<li>
			Comments to posts are now supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			Conversion engine workflow has been optimized in situations when source video files are uploaded without
			any need to convert them, and screenshots are uploaded at the same time. Before, the engine would create
			screenshot formats on the primary server. Now, it will create them on the conversion server that lets you
			decrease primary server load when you upload content in this manner.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, you can now configure offset from the end of the video when creating screenshots. You
			can also specify the name of the screenshot that should always be the default one (before, screenshot #1
			would always be selected).
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now set maximum size of watermark in % in photo album formats, just like it used to be for video
			formats.
		</li>
		<li>
			In importing and mass editing, you can now set a publishing date randomization range. This could be useful
			if you want your content to be published within a certain interval of time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category avatar generation plugin can now use photo albums to create avatars. It also supports cropping
			options.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the FTP upload plugin, you can now enable deleting of source data after it has been processed. This
			makes copying source files into the engine faster as they are renamed.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now filter content for which audit errors have been found (e.g. required files missing).
		</li>
		<li>
			Minor naming change in admin panel: Users section is now Memberzone.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now add comments from the admin panel. This is available in the context menu of objects that
			support comments, and via the context menu of comments themselves.
		</li>
		<li>
			Vendo payment processing is now supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			In export feeds, you can now filter by locale. You can also get language versions of links to pages with
			satellites taken into account. Thus, when you use locale in filters, you can make your feed return only
			videos with titles translated into this language, with all related data also translated, and with links to
			the language satellite.
		</li>
		<li>
			In a number of site blocks, video and album selection via <b>pull_videos</b> / <b>pull_albums</b>
			parameters has been optimized.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the login block, you can now display a separate error message for a deactivated user.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>video_view</b> and <b>album_view</b> blocks, the <b>show_next_and_previous_info</b> parameter is now
			used more extensively. It is used to display links to next and previous video or album. Before, it used to
			work based on object publishing date only. Now, you can configure this parameter in such a way that next and
			previous objects are selected by content provider match, and also channel match (for videos only).
		</li>
		<li>
			Videos and photo albums can now be sorted via total token purchases. This information can also be displayed in view
			blocks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- FTP timeout reduced to 10 seconds; this should prevent conversion engine from freezing for a long time
			  when there was a connection problem.<br/>
			- In filters by publishing date in admin panel, the 'to' date would not be included in the interval.<br/>
			- When editing content, administrators could create new categories and models even if they lacked
			  appropriate privileges.<br/>
			- In the rotator, the completion criterion would be calculated incorrectly for clicks that took places in
			  blocks where best screenshot display option was disabled.<br/>
			- Embed code display issues in admin panel.

	<ul>
		<li>
			The way KVS performs with HTTPS has been thoroughly tested and necessary fixes have been made. We recommend
			considering launching new sites with HTTPS version only. It may improve your search engine rankings.
		</li>
		<li>
			Major improvements in <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b> blocks:<br/>
			- The logic of dynamic filters (by category, tag etc.) has been fully rewritten. Now the filters are a lot
			  faster, which will be especially noticeable on sites with 50+ thousand content items.<br/>
			- Dynamic filters by lists of tags, models, content sources etc. have been added. Before, only category
			  lists could be used in filters. Use new parameters <b>var_tag_ids</b>, <b>var_model_ids</b>,
			  <b>var_content_source_ids</b> etc. to use these filters.<br/>
			- You can now show related videos or albums per user, i.e. show other videos or albums created by the same
			  user as current video or album.<br/>
			- You can now show (or hide) only videos or albums from certain users or models.<br/>
			- Search results can now be dynamically sorted using all the supported methods. Before, with full text
			  index search, you could only sort the results by relevancy.
		</li>
		<li>
			In language satellite configuration, you can now enable filtering by translated content. It lets you
			display only videos and albums that have translated titles for the current locale (description translations
			are not taken into account).
		</li>
		<li>
			In language satellite configuration, you can now enable selecting directories for all languages. You may
			need this to link pages in different languages between each other correctly in case separate directories
			are enabled in language settings. As different languages may have different directories, links to the same
			page in different languages may be different as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			When background tasks are completed, actual time it took the engine to complete them is now logged.
			Previously, completion duration was merely the difference between starting and completion times. This could
			be inaccurate as tasks may be sometimes queued for a while. Now, the engine analyzes only the actual time
			required to complete the task on the primary server: copying the task to a conversion server + processing
			results + the time it took the conversion server to finish the task.
		</li>
		<li>
			File uploads have been switched to HTML5 File API. Now, separate progress bar module for Nginx is not
			required. Also, displaying errors related to the size of the files being uploaded is now smoother.
		</li>
		<li>
			When CDN storage servers are connected to a local directory, KVS now shows disk space stats. Previously,
			these figures would not be analyzed for CDN servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			If an embed code in import data or import feeds is a URL, it will be automatically enclosed in iframe tag.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- If the number of screenshots in the settings was too big for the duration of a video, identical
			  screenshots would be created.<br/>
			- When displaying ads assigned to categories, these ads would be shown even when the page contained no info
			  related to categories. Now, ads with such limitations will not be shown.<br/>
			- Import feeds would sometimes create category and model duplicates when several feeds were working
			  simultaneously.<br/>
			- If publishing date and time randomization was disabled in import settings, items would be added with
			  current date and 00:00:00 time instead of the actual server time.<br/>
			- In the admin panel, videos with narrow width would prevent the player from displaying correctly.<br/>
			- Comments would not be displayed if <b>match_locale</b> parameter is enabled in comments block.

	<ul>
		<li>
			In localization language settings, you can now set whether this language needs custom directory values or
			not. Separate directories for localization have been introduced in 3.5.0. However, this feature was enabled
			with no option to disable it. After you update to 3.5.2, separate directories will be disabled by default.
			If your satellites do need separate directories, go to language settings and enable this option.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video format settings, you can now set the max % of watermark width compared to the width of the video.
			You may find this feature useful when your video format does not have a set width and same-sized watermarks
			end up looking bad on some videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import options, you can now check for embed code duplicates.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now, when you edit objects that support directories, you can now enter any directory name that will be
			saved as is. Before that, directory values would always be processed by verification and transliteration
			functions.
		</li>
		<li>
			In tags, you can now change directories. When you modify the tag's name, the directory is not automatically
			changed. You need to either clear the directory field or modify it manually.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import feeds, you can now specify the separator for list fields. Before, commas were default separators.
			Now you can use commas or semicolons.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_albums</b> block, the <b>show_main_image_info</b> parameter was added. It lets you display
			details related to main photos of each album in lists. Here, any formats and text descriptions are
			supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b>, the <b>show_flags_info</b> parameter was added. It lets you
			display total votes for any object flags in lists.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- When using multiple locales on a single domain, switching to the default locale would sometimes not get
			stored in the user session.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_5_1">KVS v3.5.1 [21.07.2014]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			When overview screenshots are re-created in bulk, now you do not need to have source files for videos.
			Screenshots can be re-created using format files.
		</li>
		<li>
			In photo album formats, you can now resize using fixed width and dynamic height.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import feed settings, you can now set feed character encoding in case it is not UTF-8.
		</li>
		<li>
			For CSV import feeds, you can use not just commas but also semicolons as separators in the screenshot list.
		</li>
		<li>
			User activity was formalized as a concept, and user ranking by activity was introduced. In member area
			settings, you can now set a custom formula to calculate activity index. You can use a variety of criteria
			as variables, e.g. total uploaded videos or photo albums, total bookmarks, total comments, total member
			area logins etc. Activity rank shows the user position on the site according to their activity. The rank is
			recalculated regularly, and user profiles show current as well as previous rankings. This lets you show not
			just the rank but the dynamics (increasing or decreasing rank).
		</li>
		<li>
			Sorting options were added to the <b>list_albums</b> block. They let you group a list of photo albums by
			publishing date, and within the date, by rating, popularity, or total photos. For videos, this option has
			been implemented before.
		</li>
		<li>
			In all categorization list blocks (list of categories, models, etc) in the <b>show_only_with_xxx</b>
			parameters you can now set minimal amount of videos or photo albums. Thus, before you could only show
			models with videos. Now, you can show models that have at least N videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the profile deletion block, users can now specify reason for deletion. You can make this field
			mandatory.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the registration block, you can now automatically remember users for N days. Thus, after registration or
			confirmation via email users will not just be logged in, as it was previously, but also remembered.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the user profile block, you can now display links to next and previous users. This improves navigation
			and is available via enabling the <b>show_next_and_previous_info</b> parameter in the block.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>search_results</b> block when displaying related queries, the current query is no more displayed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- In photo album import, default import pattern would not be selected automatically.<br/>
			- When importing photos or screenshots in archives, errors would occur if files were in a folder within the
			  archive. Now you can use such archives without errors.<br/>
			- When inserting new blocks to page templates via file system (not via the administration panel), these
			  blocks would not work using AJAX queries. Caching errors would also occasionally occur. This has been
			  fixed, and audit plugin and the site UI list show errors for these pages. Re-save these pages in the
			  administration panel to fix this.<br/>
			- New iframe embed would not redirect to the own site video page if configured.<br/>
			- A few minor 3.5.0 issues.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_5_0">KVS v3.5.0 [14.06.2014]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Iframe embed codes now work according to an entirely different concept. Previously, iframe embed codes
			would be displayed by site pages that prevented you from configuring their availability and accumulating
			statistics. The 3.5.0 update lets you switch the iframe embed code to the new engine, which gives you the
			following advantages:<br/>
			- You are now able to configure different embed code profiles for different sites. You can set up
			  completely different display templates for 'your' and 'third party' sites. You can use an unlimited
			  number of profiles.<br/>
			- Multi-format videos are now supported in embed codes. Old embed codes did not let you switch between
			  formats.<br/>
			- Embed codes now support timeline screenshots.<br/>
			- HTML ad settings are now available in embed codes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Flash embed codes will no longer be supported. Old embed codes will remain functional, new codes will be
			available as iframes only. In all new installations starting from 3.5.0, Flash embed codes will not work.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now assign HTML and popup ads in the player to additional fields of content sources, in the same
			way you could do that before for other ad types.
		</li>
		<li>
			Object directory generation for SE optimization was fully reworked. Previously, you could only use Latin
			characters in directory names. For other languages, transliteration via a separate script was used. In
			3.5.0, we added directory generation settings. You can now set max directory name length and configure
			transliteration rules. Depending on these rules, you can allow any characters, not just Latin characters.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now localize directories in the same way you could localize titles and descriptions before. When
			you use satellite sites, it lets you use not only different titles and descriptions for various objects,
			but also completely different URLs with no matches at all. In language settings, you can configure
			transliteration rules for each language.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new option in remote storage server settings lets you enable overlapping of primary site domain on
			satellites. This prevents search engines from seeing any connection between your primary site and your
			satellite sites.
		</li>
		<li>
			Users can now subscribe to content sources and models. Subscriptions let them track in the member area when
			new content related to their chosen objects is posted. KVS also lets users subscribe to channels and other
			users.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content source settings, screenshots are now handled differently. There are 2 screenshots now, just like
			models have. You can also configure their sizes and duplication in content settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			An option that lets you distribute uploaded content into 2 zones of your site was added. It lets you choose
			between: (a) all public pages, and (b) only the member area of a user. The content assigned to the member
			area of a user will be seen in this user's profile only and will not be available on common pages. Please
			contact the support department if you want to enable this feature.
		</li>
		<li>
			Photo albums now support auto-correction for orientation. KVS can automatically detect wrong image
			orientation and rotate such images to auto-correсt them.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content statistics, you can now launch mass editing for selected content items. You may want to use this
			to migrate your most or least popular content from one storage group into another.
		</li>
		<li>
			When you try to mass edit all content, you will now see a warning that prevents you from applying new
			settings to all content by accident.
		</li>
		<li>
			In website settings, you can now adjust the behavior for pseudo-videos. Previously, when users opened a
			page with a pseudo-video, they would be redirected to the exit URL in all cases. Now you can allow opening
			the page with the video on your site and display the link in the template.
		</li>
		<li>
			In album images editor, you can select all images to be deleted, just like video screenshots. In personal
			settings, you can now choose what happens when you click a video screenshot or an image in an album, either
			the viewer can be opened, or the item can be toggled for deletion.
		</li>
		<li>
			In personal settings, the option that enabled WYSIWYS editing was changed to multiple options for different
			segments of data.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the administration panel, you can now filter lists of videos, photo albums, and posts according to
			publishing date.
		</li>
		<li>
			User avatars in various formats are now supported, including animated GIFs. To enable GIF support, add the
			GIF format to the list of allowed formats in the <b>$config['image_allowed_ext']</b> option of the
			<b>/admin/include/setup.php</b> configuration file.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now set alternative delivery URLs for category avatars. This makes pages with lists of categories
			load faster. To do this, please contact the support department to have corresponding templates modified.
		</li>
		<li>
			In models and users, new options for eye color, hair color, sex, orientation, and family status were added.
			Site templates need to be modified for this to function correctly.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site settings, you can now globally disable MemCache leaving only file cache on.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now write your own script that sends mail messages.
		</li>
		<li>
			All site blocks were reworked in relation to the way asynchronous requests and POST requests in forms are
			handled. All forms can now be submitted asynchronously, and you can get data in XML or JSON formats in
			response. All errors now have unique codes. Because of this, new designs do not have duplicate checks on
			both the client and server sides. Only server-side checking is left. In upcoming updates, we will clear up
			the existing JS code from the checks, switch all the forms to asynchronous sending, and make the code as
			brief as possible.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>signup</b> block, you can now display the form that re-sends the registration confirmation email.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>signup</b> and <b>member_profile_edit</b> blocks, you can now make many of the profile fields
			mandatory (country, city, avatar, and others). Please pay attention that enabling these requires block
			template modifications.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the login block, you can now set a redirect to the user's profile page after login.
		</li>
		<li>
			In comment blocks, you can now set the minimal comment length (via the <b>min_length</b> parameter). Please
			pay attention that enabling these requires block t
			template modifications.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_models</b>, <b>list_content_sources</b> and <b>list_tags</b> blocks, you can now only
			display categorization objects that have videos OR photo albums (the <b>show_only_with_albums_or_videos</b>
			parameter). Previously, only list_categories had this feature.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_members</b> block, searching users by city independently from other data is now supported
			(the <b>var_city</b> parameter).
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_categories</b> block, you can now sort categories by the CTR of videos in these categories.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_members</b>, you can now separate users by languages or satellites (the <b>match_locale</b>
			parameter). On a particular satellite, it lets you display only users registered on this satellite.
			Currently you can separate comments, users, and events by satellites.
		</li>
		<li>
			New sorting options were added to user lists, content sources, and models.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_members_events</b> block, you can now pull data from each event object (video, photo album,
			etc.) to display more information in the event list.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_videos</b>, <b>list_albums</b>, <b>list_content</b>, <b>list_posts</b> blocks, the title and
			description of the first object in the list is now sent to the <b>$storage</b> variable. You can use this
			data in the page's meta tags.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>search_results</b> block, you can now sort search queries by alphabet, total queries, and results
			found. Also, related queries can be shown. This can be used in 2 keys: (a) display a list of related
			queries on the search results page, and (b) use auto-completion lists when users enter their queries into
			the search field.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- When copying files to storage servers, FTP chmod is no longer used.<br/>
			- In the player, timeline screenshots would be displayed outside the player frame.<br/>
			- In the player, when the playback area was clicked, the video ads would be shown each time. Now they are
			  shown on first click only.<br/>
			- Plugin-related CRON tasks would not launch on satellites.<br/>
			- The login block would not redirect users who have already logged in when they loaded the login page
			again.<br/>
			- In some cases there were issues with uploading files from URLs.

	<ul>
		<li>
			Memory usage during export was optimized. Before, exporting large amounts of data could lead to a memory
			shortage error.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video and photo album search in administration panel now also searches through extra customization fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now display extra customization fields in video and photo album lists in the administration panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now set priority for background tasks.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now use the popularity field (total views) in import, export, and also in feeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			In mass editing, you can now assign popularity within a custom range to all selected objects.
		</li>
		<li>
			In mass editing, you can now set or remove the 'needs review' flag.
		</li>
		<li>
			In import feeds, users are now supported as feed data.
		</li>
		<li>
			In flag settings, you can now enable creating member area events when certain flags are used for voting.
		</li>
		<li>
			For descriptions and custom fields, advanced HTML editor was added that replaces text areas with HTML
			editables. To enable this, contact the support department after you update your copy of KVS.
		</li>
		<li>
			In export, you can now display links to viewing pages for all satellites linked to your main site. For this
			to function correctly, your satellites need to be updated as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			Conversion engine is now optimized to handle large task queues better.
		</li>
		<li>
			Administration panel now handles photo albums better. Slideshows on thumbnail clicks were added.
		</li>
		<li>
			A range of video player and video player settings tweaks:<br/>
			- You can now assign a logo to video content sources and position it as a top or bottom bar. You can use
			  this to cover the video file watermarks with your custom clickable logos. The logo size is adjusted
			  according to the way the video is resized. The behavior is the same for full screen videos. Using this
			  feature will help you improve your monetization when showing affiliate program videos.<br/>
			- In player settings, you can now disable poster scaling.<br/>
			- In player settings, you can now disable popup ad scaling.<br/>
			- The player's HTML5 version no longer draws the central playback button, relying on internal system
			  features instead.<br/>
			- Forward and back buttons now let skip through the video.
		</li>
		<li>
			The ways lists of categories, tags and models of a video or album are displayed on the site and inside the
			admin panel were unified. Now this content is displayed on the site in exactly the way it was added in the
			admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_comments</b> block, you can now configure sorting; for example you can sort comments by
			likes.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b>, you can now set a static bookmark type (similar to the
			<b>var_fav_type</b> parameter). Before, bookmark type could only be sent via request parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			For paged lists on the site, you can now display &lt;link rel="next / prev"&gt; leading to previous and
			next pages, in accordance with Google guidelines. You can find the links required for that in
			<b>$storage</b> of each list block for which pagination is enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			When displaying related videos / albums by categories, you can set the group of categories to be used (new
			parameter <b>mode_related_category_group_id</b>).
		</li>
		<li>
			In the photo album creation block, you can now set the minimal photos threshold. Please pay attention that
			after you enable this, you will also need to make changes in the block template. This does not happen
			automatically during update.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>global_stats</b>, there is now a variable that displays total duration of all videos in hours.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- The player's mobile version would not function correctly when a dynamic bitrate limit was set in video
			  format settings.<br/>
			- In searching through content using a string, when search through categories, tags and models is enabled,
			  all found categories, tags and models are considered. Previously, only first category, tag or model that
			  was found would be used. There can be several of these due to synonyms.<br/>
			- During manual screenshot creation, crop settings would be applied twice, because of global settings and
			  settings on the screenshot creation page.<br/>
			- The conversion engine now does not return error 10 in a range of situations (errors when creating
			  screenshots from videos).<br/>
			- In certain situations, videos of optional formats would not be created if copying content to storage
			  servers was enabled in conversion server settings.<br/>
			- When uploading files from URLs, request parameters would be clipped in certain situations.<br/>
			- In the Russian language version of the administration panel, fractional numbers would be rounded when
			  saving them to the database.<br/>
			- A few minor player-related issues.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_4_1">KVS v3.4.1 [29.01.2014]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The conversion engine was optimized so that it does not rely on FTP as much when copying source files to
			the conversion servers. A new setting lets conversion servers download files from the primary server. This
			may drastically improve engine speed on primary server when you are using several conversion servers, as
			source file downloads will be parallel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Vertical videos created with mobile devices rotated at 90 degrees are now supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			Lists of videos, photo albums, and posts in the admin panel can now display only entities that either have
			already been published, or have not yet been published (taking into account their status and publishing
			date).
		</li>
		<li>
			Conversion server lists now features mass operations that let you delete, activate, and deactivate multiple
			servers. Also, you can now update API scripts automatically. This will update the API on your servers to
			newer versions as long as such versions exist.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>list_videos</b> block now supports sorting by release year.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>video_view</b> and <b>album_view</b> blocks now let you specify the favourites group a video or
			album belong to (KVS supports up to 10 groups in favourites).
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>video_view</b>, <b>album_view</b>, and <b>post_view</b> you can now display category group details
			when displaying categories.
		</li>
		<li>
			User session details now include video and album bookmark totals.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now disable click processing in video, album, or post stats when a page with this content is
			loaded. To do this, you will need to send <b>no_stats=true</b> to page parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Background task of new screenshot format creation does not stop on errors anymore. Instead, it keeps
			  working and displays an error log in the end.<br/>
			- In some situations task folders on conversion servers could not be deleted.<br/>
			- Pagination for list block with pseudo-random sorting could not be enabled.<br/>
			- The 'up to' filter by release year did not include the top value, but now it does.<br/>
			- Automated model, tag, and category selection plugins did not process queries with different case
			  correctly.<br/>
			- In <b>random_video</b>, sorting by rating/popularity for today did not work in the same way as list
			  sorting.<br/>
			- In export feeds, the partner ref would not be included in the embed code.<br/>
			- In personal settings, you could only enable the video player on video editing page in the Ultimate
			  package.<br/>
			- Directory access permissions would not be checked correctly when editing a post.<br/>
			- With PHP < 5.3, importing would not run.<br/>
			- Sorting by rating for a certain period would not include number of votes, only the total rating.<br/>
			- A few pseudo-errors in template caching check were fixed.<br/>
			- Randomization of alternative domain names in screenshot serving would not work correctly.<br/>
			- In the feed export menu, links would not work correctly.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_4_0">KVS v3.4.0 [23.12.2013]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Website UI logic has been considerably reworked, and a few important changes have been made:<br/>
			- Content related to site pages and ads is no longer stored in the database. This simplifies synchronizing
			  designs between sites, e.g. between the primary site and its language satellites as well as between
			  development and production versions.<br/>
			- Global blocks can now be used in page components. Many users faced situations when they needed to insert
			  the category or the global stats block into site header to display it on all site pages. Before, you
			  needed to insert the block into each page's template manually. Now, you just need to insert it into the
			  header once.<br/>
			- Dynamic parameters for individual blocks and pages can now be configured. This lets you avoid caching
			  issues when block or page templates need to contain data sent via a request.<br/>
			- Page and template check in Website UI and in the audit plugin have been improved and optimized
			  considerably. Now, caching issues are also detected, including incorrect session data usage and request
			  data in instances where it will not function properly.<br/>
			- In Website Settings, you can now disable caching globally.<br/>
			- Deleted pages and blocks deleted from pages can now be restored.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			In ad settings, you can now assign ads to categories and countries (via GEO_IP). When you use categories
			for ads, the engine tries to locate any category-related content in the page (e.g. when a list of videos
			from a certain category is displayed, or the page itself shows a video that has categories). In these
			situations, the ad slot will only show ads that have any category from the page assigned to them.
		</li>
		<li>
			A few key changes have been made to the player and its settings:<br/>
			- Customizable HTML ads are now supported.<br/>
			- You can now adjust the sizes of the player and the embed player in a more flexible way without modifying
			  the templates.<br/>
			- PNG and JPG images can be now used as popup banners, with customizable display time.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Posts are a new data type. These can be customized widely and can have classes. You can use posts for
			virtually anything: news, games and other data types that are not a KVS standard.
		</li>
		<li>
			Serving speed limits for video formats now have more customization options. Now you can not just set up a
			fixed bitrate but a dynamic limit as well, depending on the bitrate of each individual video. You can also
			set up different serving speed limits for users with different statuses.
		</li>
		<li>
			A group of settings has been added to the statistics module. These let you disable tracking of the data you
			don't need as well as track new data, i.e. unique video and album page visits (unique IPs checked), and
			video file / photo album requests. In addition to enabling and disabling tracking of certain type of stats,
			the settings also let you specify for how long each data type will be stored. You can use it to optimize
			certain site blocks that are statistics-based.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content statistics has been added, including ratings, visits, unique visits, file requests grouped by date
			or by individual video / photo albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			Statistics tracking content visits by registered users has been expanded. Now you can see video file and
			photo requests, while previously you could only see viewing page visits.
		</li>
		<li>
			Publishing year was added to videos, and ranges can be now used for sorting and selection.
		</li>
		<li>
			The backup plugin was rewritten; now you can schedule regular backups. New settings let you enable monthly
			backups for the past year, weekly backups for the past month, and daily backups for the past week.
		</li>
		<li>
			Integration with Segpay payment processing for purchasing tokens was expanded. One-click purchases are now
			available.
		</li>
		<li>
			Storage groups for individual videos and albums can now be manually changed on the editing page.
			Previously, you could only do that via mass editing.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now set storage groups during manual content creation and importing.
		</li>
		<li>
			When using remote CDN servers, you can now check them for free space by generating a file of a special
			format in the server's file system.
		</li>
		<li>
			In photos, the 150-character description length limit was removed.
		</li>
		<li>
			During manual screenshot creation, you can now set up first screenshot offset. Previously the offset was
			taken from content settings. Additionally, slower screenshot creation is now disabled by default and can be
			enabled manually. You may want to avoid using slower screenshot creation with longer videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the administration panel, video and album lists now feature a filter showing content uploaded by
			webmasters.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the administration panel, video and album lists now let you show directories.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the administration panel, video and album lists now feature searching content using comma-separated IDs.
		</li>
		<li>
			In trailers, minimal 5-second limit for each trailer part was removed.
		</li>
		<li>
			In export feeds, exporting customization fields is now supported. Now you can also generate a list of
			deleted videos as links to their pages.
		</li>
		<li>
			In rotator settings, you can now disable screenshot forwarding on mouseover so that users only see 1
			screenshot.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ctrl-S is now supported in all locations where it was not supported before.
		</li>
		<li>
			In storage server settings, you can now disable streaming tests. This can be useful for servers that do not
			return correct Content-Length headers, which would bring about streaming errors.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>album_view</b> block, you can now set view limits, similar to videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Yet another pagination improvement. Unlike it was done before, unknown parameters are not added to page
			URLs. This feature will not be automatically enabled after you update. Please contact the support
			department to have it enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			A group of parameters called <b>show_comments</b> was added to <b>list_videos</b>, <b>list_albums</b> and
			<b>list_content</b>. These let you display several most recent comments for each list element.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b> blocks, the <b>var_mode_related</b> parameter was added.
			It lets you change the logic of related content dynamically. Thus creating templates becomes easier if you
			intend to show tabs with related content by different criteria.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>search_results</b>, you can now select the number of search results to be used in the filter (number
			of found videos, albums, or both).
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>search_results</b> block now lets you set minimal request threshold; search requests will not be
			shown until it is reached.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>list_comments</b> now lets you display names of anonymous users who commented, as well as users country.
		</li>
		<li>
			Sorting by total comments was added to the <b>list_members</b> block. Also, string search now includes
			country names.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>member_profile_view</b>, you can now display the date when users became friends.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>list_messages</b> block now has a folder called invites that shows only friendship requests.
		</li>
		<li>
			The bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Using non-standard CSV format during import.<br/>
			- When external search was used, the number of search results would not be tracked by the search
			  stats.<br/>
			- Some temporary rotator files would not be cleaned up, which would sometimes bring about file system
			  issues with large site traffic.<br/>
			- Incorrect content was shown when users logged in after password restore.<br/>
			- The administration panel would not allow uploading JPEG images.<br/>
			- In video formats, the source file flag could not be set for formats from a standard and a premium groups
			  at the same time.<br/>
			- The category match plugin would not process tags with spaces.<br/>
			- The backup plugin created backups with incorrect file access permissions.<br/>
			- When downloading files during import, zero file size check would not be made.<br/>

	<ul>
		<li>
			English language manual on site management and configuration is now available.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- New preview screenshot re-creation task caused screenshot reset for all videos.<br/>
			- Uploading a source video file in a non-streaming format prevented it from being copied to storage
			servers.<br/>
			- Invalid xbill behavior with some prefixes.<br/>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_3_2">KVS v3.3.2 [01.09.2013]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Support for configuring additional content publishing delay was added. This makes sense for projects that
			use rsync to copy video screenshots to remote server(s). In this case you can specify a delay and stay sure
			that all screenshots are accessible when new video appears on site.
		</li>
		<li>
			In language settings it is possible now to configure localization areas (title only or both title and
			description) for different types of objects. Previously, this option was global for all object types.
		</li>
		<li>
			Photo albums now support administrator flags in the same way as videos do.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content import was enhanced with ability to specify categories per categories groups in different data
			fields. This feature is extremely useful if you use advanced categorization with category groups.
			Previously when any of the specified categories do not exist, they were auto-created with empty category
			group. Now if you specified them in data fields specific to category groups, new categories will be created
			in these groups.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>random_video</b> block <b>show_content_sources</b> / <b>skip_content_sources</b> and <b>show_dvds</b>
			/ <b>skip_dvds</b> parameters were added allowing you to filter a random video by a fixed set of content
			sources or channels.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_models</b> block, you can now disable search on description field by using the new
			<b>search_scope</b> block parameter.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b>, <b>list_albums</b> and <b>list_content</b> blocks <b>search_scope</b> parameter was
			extended with additional option in order to completely disable search on content title and description
			fields. In this case content will be searched on connected tags, categories and etc. if the corresponding
			<b>enable_search_on_xxx</b> parameters have been enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now configure <b>search_results</b> block not to include queries, which produced results count less
			than the value configured in the new <b>query_results_min</b> parameter.
		</li>
		<li>
			On KVS website we added brand new player configurator with easy steps to configure HTML advertising. If you
			use our player on your other projects - don't miss its new features! KVS 3.4.0 will provide the same in
			player settings soon.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Incorrect watermarking behavior on newer ffmpeg versions for re-sized video formats. In order this fix to
			  be applied you should make sure that all your conversion servers have API version >= 3.3.2.<br/>
			- When uploading files with non-standard SAR directly as video formats invalid handling occurred. In order
			  this fix to be applied you should make sure that all your conversion servers have API version >=
			  3.3.2.<br/>
			- Empty results in <b>search_results</b> block if pagination and any filtering were enabled.<br/>
			- Sorting content by today's rating or popularity produced poor results at the beginning of every day.<br/>

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_3_1">KVS v3.3.1 [31.07.2013]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Conversion engine now supports source files with non-standard Pixel Aspect Ratio values typical e.g. for
			videos recorded from TV broadcasts.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, you can now set a postfix for videos and photo albums that have duplicate names. When
			processing new content, the engine will check for duplicate names and add postfixes with index numbers to
			names that already exist.
		</li>
		<li>
			In lists of categorization objects, the administration panel now features a column showing total related
			content (videos and photo albums in a specific category, or with a specific tag etc.) and lets you sort the
			items.
		</li>
		<li>
			Screenshots with non-fixed sizes are now supported in screenshot resize settings. Their size depends on the
			aspect ratio of the source video file. Previously, you could only create fixed size screenshots.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b>, the <b>var_category_ids</b> parameter now has more complex
			logic. The parameter lets you send multiple category ID lists using the | separator that stands for logical
			AND. You can use it to configure advanced search using category checkboxes. For example, you can search for
			all movies in the Thrillers (ID=1) or Crime (ID=2) categories released in 2012 (ID=10) or 2013 (ID=11). To
			do this, use this <b>(1,2)|(10,11)</b> as HTTP parameter value for <b>var_category_ids</b>. This string
			will return videos that belong to either category 1 or category 2, and at the same time belong to category
			10 or 11.
		</li>
		<li>
			In all blocks, sorting by title is now not case sensitive.
		</li>
		<li>
			In multi-server configuration, you can now set the FTP connection port when it is different from 21.
		</li>
		<li>
			In content settings, check that compares the size of video screenshots and album photos uploaded via the
			administration panel to the format settings can now be disabled. By default, all uploaded images are
			checked for compatibility with the maximum sizes of the formats you configured. So, if <b>800x600</b> is
			set as the size for your format, you will not be able to upload smaller images when this check is enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site configuration, session duration for the administration panel can now be set independently from PHP
			environment variables. Contact the support department if you need to use this feature.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the content statistics plugin, total used disk space is now shown for the primary server and for storage
			servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			In export feeds, you can now use a channel filter using the feed's HTTP parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			In site UI settings, a field letting you customize URL pattern for search result pages was added. If this
			is specified, the search statistics will show links for each search query.
		</li>
		<li>
			In search statistics, information on total videos and albums found for each search query is now gathered.
			Requests for which nothing was found will not be shown in <b>search_results</b> block.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>search_results</b> block, you can now set min and max length of search queries to be shown.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and album viewing blocks, you can now show whether the current item is bookmarked by the current
			user or not. Previously this feature was not available because of caching issues.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video player usability when playing back MP4 files has been improved. Previously, the player did not show
			any progress in % before video metadata were loaded. With longer MP4 videos, metadata parts can be several
			megabytes in size and take longer to load.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Starting from version 3.3.0, in some cases the player did not resize the video to full screen
			  correctly.<br/>
			- When processing album galleries, photo availability check is not run when the server does not support
			  HEAD requests. Previously this check would return errors even when photos were available.<br/>
			- In import feeds, video title was a required parameter even if the video was inactive. This requirement
			  was removed.<br/>
			- In video and photo album import, category names could not contain commas as commas were used as category
			  separators. You can now force the use of commas by placing a slash (/) before them.<br/>
			- The <b>remote_control.php</b> control script uploaded to storage servers now detects disk space more
			  accurately when mounted directories are used.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_3_0">KVS v3.3.0 [03.07.2013]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Player full-screen mode was reworked and usability was improved:<br/>
			- Player scaling in full-screen mode was fixed and now does not depend on source video or player window
			  sizes. This also let us fix the issue when videos were not displayed correctly if the user enabled the
			full-screen mode before the video's metadata was downloaded.<br/>
			- In window mode, the player now can be dynamically scaled to any size without player
			  re-initialization.<br/>
			- Control bar behavior can now be customized so that the control bar fades out.<br/>
			- If control bar fading out is enabled, the bar will show when the video is paused.<br/>
			- Keyboard controls were added: space pauses the video while up and down adjust the sound volume.<br/>
			- Double-clicking the player switches between full-screen and regular modes.<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			In player settings, you can now set the default video slot. Previously, if no selected slot was saved in
			the user's local storage, the player selected the first available slot as the primary one. Now this
			behavior can be customized.
		</li>
		<li>
			In player settings, you can now disable remembering the selected slot in local storage. By default, the
			player remembers the slot the user selects (e.g. HD), and when serving the next video to the user, the
			player will select the default slot (provided the video has it). Now you can disable this behavior.
		</li>
		<li>
			New ad type added, shown in the middle of the player window when the user moves the mouse over the player.
			The ad stays for as long as the mouse stays over the player.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now show custom logos in any corner of the player. Previously, you could only specify the offset
			from top left hand corner.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the player's JS API, you can now intercept clicks on control bar ads and use custom JS logic.
		</li>
		<li>
			The player now has 7 slots.
		</li>
		<li>
			Integration with videoswiper.com was added, letting you add videos to KVS from this site's massive database
			via either embed codes or downloading videos to your server.
		</li>
		<li>
			Conversion engine behavior when copying files was optimized. Now you can set up files to be copied to
			storage servers directly from conversion servers. This decreases the hard drive load of your primary server
			and speeds up content processing. By default this is disabled. To enable this feature, update the
			<b>remote_cron.php</b> script on the conversion server and tick the checkbox in conversion server settings
			in the administration panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Re-creation of video overview screenshots if the video has source files was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Checkboxes to launch overview screenshots and video formats re-creation were added to video edit page in
			the administration panel. These checkboxes are available only when a video has source file. Now, when you
			replace a source file, you can re-create all video-related files fast and easy.
		</li>
		<li>
			Background task log was added, logging all background tasks after they are completed or deleted. Background
			content creation tasks are now closer tied to the content. For instance, when a background video or photo
			album creation task is deleted, the content object status is set to error instead of the object getting
			stuck in pending like it used to happen. The administration panel now lets you re-launch processing for
			content with error status, manually as well as through mass operation. Before, when background content
			creation tasks were deleted, they could not be re-launched and content was to be deleted and re-uploaded.
		</li>
		<li>
			Working directories on conversion servers can now be cleaned when background tasks already copied to
			conversion servers are deleted. Before, conversion servers would sometimes freeze when there were too many
			deleted tasks assigned to it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Database overload protection logic is now conceptually different. This lets you decrease the database load
			a lot, which is particularly important for high load sites. This new feature requires separate
			configuration. If you have database load issues, contact the support department for assistance.
		</li>
		<li>
			When content is deleted, its view page cache is now purged. Before, the content page would stay cached
			until the cache was invalidated.
		</li>
		<li>
			Old issue with new comments not showing on site because of page caching is now fixed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Localization data is now supported in import, export, and feeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			In localization language settings, you can now specify the localization area: titles and descriptions, or
			titles only. This defines whether description fields are shown during translation, and also defines the way
			translated / not translated object filters work in the administration panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and photo album import and export, you can now select the content source URL field.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and photo album export, you can now export row with data field names.
		</li>
		<li>
			Premium videos are now supported in import feeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			In CSV export feeds, you can now specify static values for any field using static:&lt;value&gt;. When such
			a column is specified, the feed will show &lt;value&gt; for each row.
		</li>
		<li>
			In export feeds, you can now send not just your preferred embed player width, but also the height. Thus you
			can now generate embed codes with fixed sizes, all sizes or just one (height or width).
		</li>
		<li>
			In Statistics, you can now distribute permissions between administrators in a more advanced and detailed
			way.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now remove search queries from search statistics.
		</li>
		<li>
			In Personal Settings, you can now show or hide the video player on the video edit page in the
			administration panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Keyboard shortcuts for the Save (Ctrl+S) and Save and close (Ctrl+Shift+S) buttons was added. In Personal
			Settings, you can customize the button order, which lets you set Save and edit next as the first available
			action.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now delete users with all their content with just one click.
		</li>
		<li>
			Category auto-select plugin now can grab categories from tags.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models have new fields: Country, City, State.
		</li>
		<li>
			In referrer traffic statistics, comparison logic is now different when the referrer is a URL without http.
			In this case, the statistics will count not the site the user came from, but the URL of the page they
			visited. This lets you track traffic from partners who send it to your site with a custom parameter, e.g.
			http://domain.com?from=username. Traffic can come from various websites. To track all this traffic under
			one referrer, set its URL to <b>from=username</b>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pagination logic when pages do not exist is now different. These pages now return the 404 error. This fix
			may affect certain site pages and it is not enabled by default in this update. Contact the support
			department to have this enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			Access settings for site pages now let you make certain pages available to webmasters and trusted users
			only.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>video_edit</b> and <b>album_edit</b> blocks, visual protection from automated submissions was
			added.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>video_edit</b> block, you can now show channel list to upload a video to a certain channel on
			your site.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_albums</b>, <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_content</b> blocks, you can now display content
			uploaded by users from the current user's country.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_albums</b>, <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_content</b> blocks, <b>search_scope</b> is a new
			parameter letting you search through titles only and not descriptions.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_albums</b>, <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_content</b> blocks, when search through categories,
			tags and models is enabled, the search will also include synonyms (pseudonyms).
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and photo album upload, KVS will now check whether space is used as tag separator. KVS requires
			tags to be separated by commas, but many people use tags separated by spaces, which previously led to all
			tags separated in such a way being treated as a single tag. Now this is fixed.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>list_content_sources</b> block, sorting content sources by albums was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>global_stats</b> block, you can now filter by categories, i.e. show statistics for content from a
			certain category.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>list_dvds</b> block now has a new parameter, <b>var_section</b>, letting you build an alphabetic
			list of channels / DVDs.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>video_edit</b> block now supports separate max video duration settings for premium and webmaster
			users.
		</li>
		<li>
			Country codes in the <b>$list_countries_codes</b> variable are now available in the templates.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Videos with ad links would not pause when the user clicks on video area.<br/>
			- The video slots shown in the player did not depend on whether the video file is available, if the user
			  has no access to this particular video format. This resulted in the slot shown with an ad link, although
			  the slot would not show if the user had sufficient permissions.<br/>
			- Problems with randomization of ad display if the page had several instances of the same ad spot.<br/>
			- Video uniqueness was not detected correctly by import if instead of the link to the source file links to
			  format files were provided.<br/>
			- Uploaded images would not resize if their file names had spaces.<br/>
			- Issues with pagination for number-based tags.<br/>
			- Export feeds did not send the correct embed code sizes for hotlinked videos.<br/>
			- HTTP parameters would not be removed when file names were assigned to videos uploaded via links on
			  site.<br/>
			- When object directories were manually changed in the administration panel, this could lead to faulty
			  links.<br/>
			- In list blocks, <b>skip_xxx</b> and <b>show_xxx</b> did not work correctly. They were triggered even when
			  particular filter objects were sent to the lists. This resulted in empty lists. For instance, if in
			  <b>list_videos</b> block the <b>skip_categories</b> parameter with a category list was enabled, this
			  block would show empty list for all of these categories.<br/>
			- In site engine, when the user status was refreshed, no user deactivation check was made. Thus, a logged
			  in user was able to use the site until their session was active, even if this particular user was
			  deactivated in the administration panel.<br/>
			- Content statistics plugin did not track certain video content types.<br/>
			- Some issues with photo gallery processing.<br/>
			- When the audit plugin made a content check, screenshot source sizes were not checked. This could result
			  in some faulty source files went undetected.<br/>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Basic subscription functionality was added, now letting users subscribe to channels or other users. In the
			<b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_album</b> blocks, there is a new mode now that displays content from
			subscriptions. Also, a block called <b>list_members_subscriptions</b> was added. It displays a list of your
			or any user's subscriptions and lets you manage them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Splitting DVDs / channels into groups is now available. This new feature introduces a full-featured
			three-tier content structure, e.g. TV Show > Seasons > Episodes. Now you can use groups of channels / DVDs
			as TV Shows; these support screenshots of 2 sizes and can be displayed separately on your site as a list
			(the <b>list_dvds_groups</b> block) and as a viewing page (the <b>dvd_group_view</b> block).
		</li>
		<li>
			The synonymizer plugin was reworked to make entering synonyms easier. Now, a single dictionary string can
			just list words that are synonyms for each other, and the plugin will replace them within their groups.
			This makes building a thesaurus for your site much simpler.
		</li>
		<li>
			In video and photo album mass editing, you now can change the content author to an author in the list that
			was randomly selected.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are now 5 dynamic HTTP parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the administration panel, there are now more columns in the user list. You can adjust the way user lists
			are displayed in personal settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			On the video / photo album editing pages in the administration panel, the status drop-down list was
			replaced with active / inactive checkbox.
		</li>
		<li>
			Searching templates in the administration panel now includes block configuration parameters as well. So,
			searching for a parameter will get you all blocks on all pages where this parameter is enabled. Parameter
			values are also searchable now.
		</li>
		<li>
			When background tasks of creating new screenshot or photo album formats are deleted, shutdown is forced.
			Before, if such a task was started, it was active until finished (or until an error occurred) even if the
			task was deleted. Now, deleting a task should cancel it.
		</li>
		<li>
			New plugin was added, letting you calculate the disk space used by different content files.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the administration panel, installation details now include % of memcache usage.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additional file fields were added to content source, with as many as 10 fields there now.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support of the pre_initialize_page_code.php script was added to site engine. This script is launched when
			the engine starts and lets you replace GET parameters values of which influence the way site caching works.
			You can use this feature to show different variants of a page to users by replacing a parameter in a GET
			request, depending on the value of a user session flag.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>var_items_per_page</b> parameter was added to all list blocks. Enable this to dynamically adjust the
			number of elements on a page in lists.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b> blocks, the <b>var_category_group_ids</b> parameter is now
			supported. It lets you dynamically send list of category groups content from which you want to display. You
			can use it to hide certain categories in certain situations, e.g. hide adult-only content.
		</li>
		<li>
			When the <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b> blocks display content of multiple categories or groups
			of categories via the <b>var_category_ids</b> or <b>var_category_group_ids</b> parameters, you can now use
			the AND logic instead of the default OR logic. To do so, you need to send the '<b>all</b>' keyword as one
			of the list elements.
		</li>
		<li>
			Impressions of album photos are now counted if they are opened on different pages (if they are dynamically
			loaded on a single page only the impression of the main album photo will be counted). This impression
			statistics can be used in the <b>list_album_images</b> block for sorting.
		</li>
		<li>
			Blocks displaying lists of videos, photo albums, and models now support the <b>search_redirect_disabled</b>
			parameter that lets you disable the redirect which happens by default if search results feature only 1
			element. Enable this parameter if you offer video and photo album (and possibly model) search on the same
			page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pseudo-random sorting was added to the <b>list_albums</b> block.
		</li>
		<li>
			Global mode letting you display a global list of user playlists was added to the <b>list_playlists</b>
			block.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <b>random_video</b> block now supports ratings and video flags.
		</li>
		<li>
			A set of parameters <b>show_xxx_info</b> was added to the <b>list_content</b> block. These let you select
			more content-related info.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the top search queries block, you can now set the period in days to display the top for this period.
		</li>
		<li>
			User session now features a full set of user details.
		</li>
		<li>
			Documentation covering KVS settings was updated.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Testing how the content is served from a server worked incorrectly if a custom streaming parameter was
			  used.<br/>
			- X-bill: periodical requests from the billing caused errors to show in the log, these are to be
			  ignored.<br/>
			- When a new server was added to a group with content, checking for content availability did not give error
			  details and did not let you add the server. This was fixed; now, servers are saved but errors are
			  displayed. You can address the errors on the serving test page.<br/>
			- Email validation algorithm was outdated and is now much simpler.<br/>
			- Conversion engine got looped when conversion servers were deleted during an active conversion phase.<br/>
			- Video content protection by referrer could be triggered for your own subdomains.<br/>
			- Categories in the administration panel were not sorted alphabetically.<br/>
			- When page prefix was used, some links in separate pagination blocks were incorrect.<br/>

			Redirecting to a random album was added (<b>/redirect_random_album.php</b>), similar to redirecting to a
			random video.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- The player used sizes of the preview image by default, unless sizes were in the video's metadata. This
			  could lead to incorrect aspect ratios;<br/>
			- Third party library for processing ZIP archives was updated. The update features a fix for the bug when
			  the script would run out of memory when processing large files;<br/>
			- Freezing conversion tasks fixed. If for some reason ffmpeg quits unexpectedly during conversion, the
			  script will finish the task and log an error after 2 attempts;<br/>
			- Standard embed codes did not work for deactivated videos;<br/>
			- Member area settings saved on the main site would not be picked up by satellite sites.<br/>

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_1_0">KVS v3.1.0 [05.03.2013]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Stop words and replacements for them were added. Prevent your visitors from posting illegal or unwanted
			content by having KVS replace all the detected stop words with the replacements of your choice. Stop words
			are also removed from all search queries so that no stop words appear in stats and on your site's pages.
		</li>
		<li>
			Minor import feed improvements:<br/>
			- 'Check needed' flag added to import feed settings for all videos being added;<br/>
			- Importing custom reflinks for content sources and importing groups of content sources was added, as long
			  as such info is contained in the feed data (CSV);<br/>
			- Now all feeds can be launched manually;<br/>
			- Key fields can now be specified without binding them to video data;<br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			In album formats, you can now select resizing with fixed height and dynamic width. Enable this option to
			set fixed height for all images of a chosen format.
		</li>
		<li>
			Engine behavior when creating thumbnails if source image is smaller than the format requires is now
			different. Now, the engine will upscale the source image to fit the set sizes. This change affects video
			screenshots and album pictures.
		</li>
		<li>
			For token-based premium access, you can now set puchased content availability limit, i.e. when the access
			expires.
		</li>
		<li>
			Token purchase transactions can now be canceled. When such transaction is canceled, the previously
			purchased amount of tokens will be deducted from the user's account. If there are not enough tokens to
			deduct from, access to certain purchased content will be automatically disabled to restore the account
			balance.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Upgrade</b> block was added, letting standard registered users purchase premium access and tokens.
			Previously, upgrading user accounts to premium status was handled by the <b>signup</b> block. Starting from
			branch 3 of the software, the signup block no longer handles account upgrades.
		</li>
		<li>
			In <b>video_edit</b> / <b>album_edit</b> blocks, you can now adjust the maximum number of categories using
			block parameters (previously up to 3 categories were allowed).
		</li>
		<li>
			The JavaScript of the player's API was completely reworked. Easy integration of JS / HTML ads is now
			available. Check the player's public documentation for the new API details.
		</li>
		<li>
			JS handlers for format change in the player were added. Use them to run a custom JS script instead of
			format change or redirect, e.g. to display a popup with access purchase details.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the update plugin, updating can now be canceled during the first step when general update info is
			displayed.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the <b>list_content</b> block, you can now use dynamic content source group filtering.
		</li>
		<li>

			v3.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bugs that have been fixed:<br/>
			- Localization issues in the popup of the <b>video_edit</b> block;<br/>
			- If a clickthrough link was specified for the player video area, the playback didn't stop when the area
			  was clicked;<br/>
			- Repeated playback in the player didn't work via JS API;<br/>
			- Issues with MP4 file streaming check on storage servers sometimes generating false errors;<br/>
			- Player didn't load if its size was set in % (e.g. 100%);<br/>
			- The rotator didn't count clicks if the page didn't receive the video directory parameter;<br/>
			- The <b>list_playlists</b> block removed video duplicates from video lists when <b>pull_videos</b> was
			  used which is logically incorrect.<br/>

		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_3_0_0">KVS v3.0.0 [17.12.2012]</h3>
	<h4>Conversion and storage engine</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			CDN integration was completely re-implemented. Previously KVS supported limited CDN providers, but starting
			from v3 you can use any CDN provider. In order to do that, CDN provider should implement API script so that
			KVS can use it (redirect to content + invalidation).
		</li>
		<li>
			Added a new function to completely check content serving from a particular storage server. Older versions
			had functions "test direct link", "test protected link" and "test streaming". The new version grouped these
			functions into one option, which can do everything automatically and display summary for you. All checks
			consider different content protection options: direct links to video files should not work, direct links
			to album files should work only for publicly allowed formats and etc. This new option lets you easily check
			the valid configuration of each storage server.
		</li>
		<li>
			Enhanced integration between main server and remote conversion servers. Main server now displays the
			configured server libraries and their echo responses for every conversion server. It is also possible to
			specify conversion server timezone offset if needed in order to prevent fake errors.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video formats were extended with ability to configure per-sponsor duration limits using sponsor custom
			fields (similar to customization of different watermarks for different sponsors).
		</li>
		<li>
			When a multipart trailer is created, it is now possible to configure so that the last trailer part is
			taken from the end of last fragment. Previously all trailer parts were taken from the beginning of
			fragments, including the last part.
		</li>
		<li>
			Dramatically optimized the way of creating many similar trailers with different size / quality options.
		</li>
		<li>
			When a video format is being re-created via mass edit, it is now possible to disable watermark for this
			operation. This option makes great sense if another format file acts as a source file and it already has
			watermark - in this case no double watermarking will take place.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to delete timeline screenshots for any video format, where timeline screenshots are disabled.
			You can use this option if you want to get more free space and you don't need timeline screenshots for this
			format anymore.
		</li>
		<li>
			Thumb creation logic was completely rewritten to reduce the number of subsequent ImageMagick operations
			and optimize the resulting image quality.
		</li>
		<li>
			Background tasks logging was improved. Ability to see done % was added for all tasks with considering
			conversion server execution part.
		</li>
		<li>
			Formats for video screenshots were extended with additional ImageMagick options field, which is intended
			to be used for all screenshots that are uploaded manually. Previously for all manually uploaded screenshots
			there were no any ImageMagick options applied (only resize and watermark were applied) so that there was
			no any ability to post-process the uploaded screenshots with ImageMagick. Now this is fixed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to create video screenshots format with source size (not resized to any particular size). In
			order to do that you should specify predefined word <b>source</b> as a format size.
		</li>
		<li>
			Each background task now has its own log.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Premium access</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added support for token-based access in addition to time-limited access. Tokens are available for standard
			(non-premium) members and can be purchased via payment system or "awarded" via community actions. Members
			can spent their available tokens to get premium access to particular content. At the same type members will
			remain in standard / active status, but when accessing the purchased content their status will be
			considered as premium. According to that, you can combine time-limited and token-based access options on
			your site without any restrictions.
		</li>
		<li>
			To facilitate the extended memberzone functionality KVS now has a separate Memberzone Settings page, where
			you can enable token based access for particular types of content (separate settings for standard / premium
			videos and albums) and configure their default prices. For any particular video / album you can manually
			override its price using standalone editing or mass edit.
		</li>
		<li>
			Memberzone Settings page also contains ability to configure awards for members' activity. An award is the
			number of granted tokens for a particular action, such as initial signup, avatar upload, posting a comment
			(with ability to limit minimum length), uploading a video (with ability to limit minimum duration),
			creating an album (with ability to limit minimum image count).
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to display list of purchased videos and albums for each member.
		</li>
		<li>
			The awaited relative publishing dates enhancement was added. It allows configuring relative publishing dates
			for content, so that this content becomes visible to a member after some period of his activity in
			memberzone. This option can only be enabled from low level system config, because it greatly affects the
			functionality of site and admin panel; by default it is disabled. If enabled, you will be able to configure
			days offset for every video and album: positive offset means that this content will become visible on N-th
			day after registration (for example <b>1</b> means that content will become visible immediately after
			registration, <b>10</b> means that content will become visible on 10th day after registration). Negative
			offset is also allowed and means that (a) this content will be visible all the time, even if user is not
			registered / logged in, (b) its publishing date will always be shifted according to the current date. For
			example relative publishing date <b>-10</b> means that content will appear to be added 10 days ago,
			regardless of the today's date. Relative publishing dates can be combined together with absolute publishing
			dates, e.g. one part of your content may use one concept, the other part - another concept.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to integrate KVS site with any affiliate system, which works via .htpasswd files. Now you
			can easily migrate any affiliate website to KVS - you only need to place a special KVS script into a folder
			protected by .htpasswd file, managed by your affiliate system. This script will automatically create users
			in KVS database if required and will log them in. At the same time there are no needs for any changes in
			the way your affiliate system works, just your old site will be replaced with the new KVS-powered site.
		</li>
		<li>
			Signup block was extended to allow using auto-generated unique name / password pairs, so that users are
			not required to input them manually when trying to sign up. In this case signup form will be shorted to
			just payment option selection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Payment processors logging concept is completely re-written in the new version. All events are logged into
			database, which allows their analysis with filtering.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Multilanguage support for site and content</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			One the most complicated changes in v3 is data localization support. You can configure several additional
			languages in admin panel and translate titles / descriptions for all content and categorization. The new
			UI was added to support translation activity.
		</li>
		<li>
			Website engine was enhanced to allow switching into localized mode for any of the additional languages.
			Displaying site in localized mode does not require you to have 100% translations done: if some of the
			objects are not yet translated, they will be displayed with original titles / descriptions. The new version
			also allows using language files for template texts (GUI elements, language CSS files and etc). The more
			detailed explanation of KVS localization approach will be provided in documentation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Website comments blocks provide ability to display only comments posted in the current locale - each
			comment stores the locale it was posted in. This option is disabled by default so that all comments will
			be displayed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added audit log analyzer plugin, which is intended to provide you with summary information about
			your content managers' activity. In addition to that, it can also be used to calculate translation effort
			put by your translators.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Albums</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Completely re-implemented albums storage engine to use the similar multiserver concept as for videos.
			Now you can create a separate storage group to store albums sources, formats and ZIP files (albums and
			videos cannot use the same storage group, should have different groups).
		</li>
		<li>
			Albums creation tasks are handled by conversion servers now.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to upload album source images one by one, not only in ZIP file.
		</li>
		<li>
			The overall albums functionality in admin panel was extended to ~ the same as for videos: added
			"descwriter" mode support, added optional images display on album edit page, extended the number of albums
			list filters.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for image gallery import.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Player</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added basic support for HTML5 mode. HTML5 mode can only be used when playing MP4 files and will be enabled
			automatically if user's device has no Flash support.
		</li>
		<li>
			Player settings allow choosing embed code mode: iframe (supports HTML5) or standard embed (supports only
			Flash). This setting affects all embed codes, generated by KVS.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you have multiple video formats displayed in the player, the format user selected last time will be
			remembered and automatically selected for other videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Putting mouse over the clickable logo will cause blurring effect to emphasize that logo is clickable.
		</li>
		<li>
			Fixed several Flash-security problems that were previously provided in a separate patch.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Content import and feeds</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Import usability: added cancellable background tasks for import processes and enabled protection from main
			server HDD overflow. Now each time you start content import you will see background task, which shows
			completion % and has its log. You can remove this task if you want to cancel import. If main server HDD has
			free space less than the configured limit, all import processes will pause and will wait for more free
			space. This issue can happen if you import a big volume of data, which is temporarily downloaded to your
			main server for future processing.
		</li>
		<li>
			Text data for all imports will be saved on main server. Therefore you will be able to find any data you
			imported before.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added check for URL duplicates, which can be used to protect you from importing duplicate set of data.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for categories synonyms and models aliases during import. New categories / models will not be
			created, if your database already has categories / models with such synonyms / pseudonyms.
		</li>
		<li>
			When importing pseudo video it is now possible to detect duration and create screenshots automatically
			based on the given video file URL. This can help to create sites with the same content, but different sets
			of screenshots.
		</li>
		<li>
			Changed the logic of duplicate videos detection in importing feeds. Older version used feed URL domain for
			building a unique video key, which caused problems if there are several different feeds working on the same
			domain and returning different videos with the same ID. In new version you can manually configure prefix
			for building unique video keys for every feed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Feeds logging concept is completely re-written in the new version. All events are logged into database,
			which allows their analysis with filtering.
		</li>
		<li>
			Exporting feeds were extended with duration filters, ability to return only videos with completed
			screenshots rotation and ability to return temporary video file URLs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Website engine</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Added support for defining global blocks: these are blocks, which are not connected to any particular page.
			Each global block has only 1 instance of its settings and template, which allows you change in one place in
			order to affect many site pages, where these blocks are inserted. Global blocks are intended to be used for
			displaying the same global piece of data on different site pages (for example, global list of tags or
			categories displayed at each page. Earlier you had to insert a block on each page and duplicate its
			settings on many pages. With global blocks support you can specify settings only once.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now group site pages using title prefix.
		</li>
		<li>
			For each website page it is possible now to completely disable it at any time, also you can configure
			member's access level required to open a page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Countries list can be used in any template now. Also we can provide you with country flag icons on demand
			(by default flag icons are not included).
		</li>
		<li>
			Fixed some issues with trade scripts integration.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Community</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Members can now create their channels and manage them. For each channel they can configure who can post
			videos there: all users, only friends or channel owner only.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added flagging support for channels.
		</li>
		<li>
			New community feature - playlists. Members can create their own playlists and manage them. Also support for
			several favourites groups was added, which you can use according to your ideas. These new features will
			allow displaying a dropdown with playlists / favourites groups when users are trying to add a video / album
			to their favourites. It is also possible to move content between favourites.
		</li>
		<li>
			Members can now be marked as trusted, which means that all their activity is not required to be reviewed
			by administrator.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to display content visiting history for any member.
		</li>
		<li>
			Members are allowed to add / change their status message. Changing a status message will trigger a
			community event.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mass emailings are enhanced with ability to filter receivers by status: all active members, only premium
			members or only webmasters.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is possible now to enter nick during signup process (in addition to username). Previously nick was
			always set equal to username and the only possibility to change it was to use profile change flow.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Comments</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Comments storage structure was completely changed; comments section in admin panel was migrated to users
			section. In the new version comments for all objects are displayed in plain list. This change helped to
			dramatically increase <b>list_comments</b> block performance.
		</li>
		<li>
			Anonymous comments can now be assigned with a signature.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for smileys and bb-code.
		</li>
		<li>
			For every comments block it is now possible to configure, whether comments from registered members require
			administrator approval.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Admin panel and usability</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			One of the main changes - "enable support access" button was moved to start page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Update plugin: for your convenience we decided to use cumulative update approach rather than sequential
			approach. Now in order to update to any future version you will need to go through update procedure only
			once.
		</li>
		<li>
			The number of left login attempts will now be displayed on admin panel login page if you enter invalid
			credentials and bruteforce protection is enabled.
		</li>
		<li>
			Each admin panel list supports continuous multiselection with 2 clicks. Click the topmost checkbox for
			your selection and then click the lowest one with holding Shift key. All checkboxes inside this interval
			should be selected.
		</li>
		<li>
			Videos / albums mass edit can be started for any filtered objects list, even if they are not displayed on
			one page. Now you don't need to adjust pagination control in order to be able to select a big volume of
			objects at a time and start mass editing over them. Just configure the filter and choose the corresponding
			option in batch actions list.
		</li>
		<li>
			When using categories / models selector it is possible now to create new categories / models on-the-fly.
			In order to do that you should simply input new object name and select the corresponding option in the
			dropdown list (new object). When saving the current video or album all new categories / models will be
			created. Additional new feature is that you can copy-paste comma-separated categories / models right into
			the field.
		</li>
		<li>
			Objects, which support flagging, now display all assigned flags on their editors in admin panel (videos,
			albums, DVDs / channels) and allow deleting any flags.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for mass renaming tags in admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Traffic stats now count page views not only for videos, but for albums as well.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mass edit enhancements: added support to set 0 rating and change content owner (administrator, who acts as
			an owner of this content). The last feature can be useful to divide content between multiple content
			managers, so that they do not step into each other's work. In order to do that you should configure that
			each content manager administrator account has access only to the owned content - this can be done in
			administrator settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			Several new filters and columns for display were added for videos and albums in admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stats section improved navigation between different stats pages.
		</li>
		<li>
			When displaying different images in admin panel (screenshots, photos) KVS will now adjust to your screen
			resolution automatically.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added options to lock a video / album directory field to its title. If enabled, directory field will become
			read-only and will always reflect changes in object title (e.g. it will change automatically each time a
			title is modified). This makes sense for you if your content managers assign final titles to the content;
			in this case you can always be sure that they do not forget to change directory accordingly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin panel has a new top level section called Administration, which includes many pages from older
			Settings not related to any settings. Some options from System Settings sub-section were migrated to
			another sub-sections; System Settings sub-section itself was renamed to Content Settings.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Site blocks</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			System config was extended with an option to move JS static files to CDN. This is not possible from
			templates as JS files are included automatically by site engine.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support to show related videos / albums by title. These new modes are available in
			<b>mode_related</b> parameter of <b>list_videos</b> and <b>list_albums</b> blocks.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>list_dvds</b> block was extended to display a portion of videos for each DVD / channel in the list. In
			order to do that you should enable <b>pull_videos</b> block parameter and specify limit / sorting in
			additional parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>list_albums</b> block was extended with <b>show_image_info</b> parameter, which allows displaying all
			images for each album in the list.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>list_videos</b>, <b>list_albums</b> and <b>list_content</b> blocks were extended with
			<b>skip_content_sources</b> and <b>show_content_sources</b> parameters, which allow filtering out the
			displayed content by content sources. <b>list_videos</b> block was also extended with <b>skip_dvds</b> and
			<b>show_dvds</b> parameters, which allow filtering out the displayed content by DVDs / Channels.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now on video view and album view pages you can put next / previous links, which will open next / previous
			video or album based on publishing date sorting. In order to add these links you should enable
			<b>show_next_and_previous_info</b> parameter, which was added to <b>video_view</b> and <b>album_view</b>
			blocks.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>list_categories</b> block was extended with <b>show_only_with_albums_or_videos</b> parameter, which
			can be used to show only those categories, which have at least 1 video or album.
		</li>
		<li>
			Dynamic filtering by content source group was added to <b>list_videos</b> block.
		</li>
		<li>
			The new version implemented support for passing video filename / album ZIP archive filename when
			downloading them. In order to do that you should add download_filename=&lt;filename&gt; parameter to
			the download link.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Other features</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Models were extended with eye color field.
		</li>
		<li>
			Categories were extended with more custom fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to define white list of IPs was added to video grabbing protection feature. Now you can configure
			list of IPs which should never be blocked. Also it is possible to see all IPs which are currently blocked.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for model aliases (similar to synonyms for categories and tags). Additional plugin was
			added to autopick models based on content title / description.
		</li>
		<li>
			Categories autoselection plugin was enhanced with the ability to specify in which cases it should be
			triggered. In older versions this plugin was only triggered if video / album had no categories.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="section_whats_new_2_4">KVS v2.4</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_4_4">KVS v2.4.4 [03.06.2012]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			There is a new plugin which provides ability to create videos / albums based on uploaded to FTP files. We
			think this may be the most convenient way of creating big amounts of content. For videos you can upload
			standalone source files, as well as subfolders with many files which are video formats and overview
			screenshots. For albums you can upload standalone archives with photos, as well as subfolders with
			individual image files there. Plugin works in the following way. First you should upload source data into
			several server folders (plugin supports separate source folders for standard videos, premium videos and
			albums). After that you should run plugin over these source folders: plugin will analyze them and display
			overview of the found content. Finally after your review plugin will import the selected content.
		</li>
		<li>
			A huge optimization was implemented for video download script with regard to the way it utilizes PHP
			sessions. Testing on top-traffic sites showed that sessions utilization reduced greatly after the fix.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additional optimization was done for stats calculation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Flagging videos and albums now allows optional text messages in addition to flag vote. Admin panel was
			extended to allow viewing these messages.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video formats were extended with ability to customize watermark image for different content sources. This
			will allow you have different logos on videos from different sponsors.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video formats were extended with ability to specify, which format should be used as a source for other
			video formats. Earlier a video format with the maximum filesize was always used. Now there is a way to
			force any particular format to be used as a source.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to specify timezone offset was added to storage server settings. The may be useful for adding
			remote servers, which timezone is different from the main server's timezone - earlier it was required to
			configure the same timezone on all storage servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Videos and albums blocks (list_videos and list_albums) were enhanced with the following features: ability
			to display lists for particular alphabet letters, ability to display lists for several categories at the
			same time, ability to search on custom fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video editor in admin panel was extended to select the main screenshot without need to switch to video
			screenshots editor.
		</li>
		<li>
			Website search logic was changed for the search method, which searches on query components: components
			which are less than 2 characters are not used in search; this fix increases search results quality.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is allowed now to completely disable rotator for a particular list_videos block.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mass edit operations for videos and albums were extended with ability to lock the selected videos / albums
			from editing on website; also it became possible to run any post-processing plugins at any time (for
			example, tags autogeneration, synonymizer).
		</li>
		<li>
			In models it is possible now to specify the fixed age rather than birthday. When you specify birthday, the
			model's age is constantly increasing when time goes, which is not desired in some cases.
		</li>
		<li>
			Memberzone access protection was enhanced. Earlier when banned temporarily there was an email sent to
			member with unban link. Now member's access password is reset to a randomly-generated one, the new password
			is being specified in the email sent to the banned member. Due to the password change, nobody from
			third-party users can have access using this member's credentials. All attempts to restore account to the
			old password will be forbidden.
		</li>
		<li>
			Photo albums ZIP processing improved. Photos are always extracted in the alphabetic order (in comparison to
			the old version, where photos extracted in the order they were added to ZIP). Also all invalid files and
			folders, which can be zipped accidentally, are ignored.
		</li>
		<li>
			Audit plugin was enhanced with ability to check how each video file is served by storage servers. The
			existing check didn't allow that and only checked video files on HDD and their file size.
		</li>
		<li>
			The number of custom text fields for DVDs / channels was increased to 10.
		</li>
		<li>
			Severe player issues were fixed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_4_3">KVS v2.4.3 [25.03.2012]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			NATS integration added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added Universal CDN support (ucdn.com).
		</li>
		<li>
			Admin panel permission system was extended. You can configure now if administrators have access to all
			videos / albums or only to videos / albums they've created. This will allow creating limited administrators,
			who can log on into admin panel and work with their own content (upload, edit, delete, post-process
			screenshots / photos). At the same time they won't have access to videos and albums created by other
			administrators or website users.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new KVS update plugin was added, which provides convenient step-by-step interface for updating your KVS
			project to a new version.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models now store the date of their last content update. This field is re-calculated every 8 hours due to
			optimization reasons. You can use this field to display it in templates or for models list sorting.
		</li>
		<li>
			The number of models custom text fields was extended to 10.
		</li>
		<li>
			The ability to hide a subset of models from public site area was added. This can be achieved by using a new
			model field, which controls user's access level required for being able to see the model.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to display related videos by DVD / channel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Logon block was extended with option, which allows configuring whether only Premium members can log in.
			This option can be used if you want to prevent standard members from logging in.
		</li>
		<li>
			In admin panel you can now change video / album status on screnshots / photos page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_4_2">KVS v2.4.2 [06.03.2012]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Audit plugin was extended with security criteria check: checks for redundant write permissions on system
			files and folders, checks for direct web access to some folders and some other.
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of website pages creation / removal has been changed. Earlier in order to create a new page
			you had to enable write permissions to the project root folder. Now you should manually copy the required
			PHP file into project folder before creating a page. In the same way you should manually remove page PHP
			file before removing a page. Therefore there is no need to violate security policy of file access to the
			root project folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added audit plugin documentation with information about all possible errors, warnings and information
			messages it can return.
		</li>
		<li>
			The possible list of sortings was extended for models list block (list_models).
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_4_1">KVS v2.4.1 [12.02.2012]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A block was added to support members' profiles deletion (member_profile_delete). Members can only request
			profile deletion, but the actual deletion is performed by an administrator.
		</li>
		<li>
			Login block's logic was updated with built-in ajax handling, which you can use to log on members without
			passing them to login page.
		</li>
		<li>
			In videos formats settings you can now configure height-based resize option in addition to width-based
			resize. This may be useful if you want your video files to match video resolution standards (720p, 1080p
			and etc).
		</li>
		<li>
			A new block was added to render mixed lists of video and photo content (list_content). This block can
			display videos and albums using the same set of filters and sorting.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new block was added to display tag cloud both for videos and albums at the same time (tags_cloud_v2).
		</li>
		<li>
			Albums were enhanced to have many categories (prior to this version every album could only have 1 category).
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now skip any data field (column) in videos / albums import.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to specify main image number in import data was added to albums import.
		</li>
		<li>
			Importing feeds were fixed to be processed in parallel. This change improves overall feed performance when
			you have several feeds that download video files at a low network speed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Player formats switcher issue was fixed. When user selects another video quality using formats dropdown box,
			player will start the new video file from the current position instead of starting it from the beginning as
			it worked before.
		</li>
		<li>
			"Remember me" option was added to logon block.
		</li>
		<li>
			Models list block (list_models) was enhanced with model age filtering (from-to) as well as with search on
			models' titles and descriptions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to completely disable website from admin panel was added. When your website is disabled, a static
			HTML file (/website_unavailable.html) will be displayed to users. You can modify this file based on your
			needs.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new option was added to videos / albums import. This option allows you configure if the imported videos /
			albums categories should be taken from their content source categories.
		</li>
		<li>
			Duration filtering (from-to) was added to videos list block (list_videos).
		</li>
		<li>
			KVS admin panel administration feature was extended to allow configuring permissions for settings area.
			Previously only super-administrator can access settings area. Now you will be able to configure access to
			settings area for limited administrator accounts via standard permissions workflow.
		</li>
		<li>
			Flags support was added to albums similar to videos. However in albums flags can be assigned to separate
			album images, not to the whole album (actually rating and comments work in the same way for albums). In
			other aspects albums flags work exactly as for videos (for example, you can configure rating via flags
			instead of using traditional star-based rating).
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to pull related albums was added to categories block (list_categories), models block (list_models)
			and content sources block (list_content_sources).
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_4_0">KVS v2.4.0 [10.12.2011]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Importing and exporting feeds were extended with directory and username fields handling.
		</li>
		<li>
			New feature in screenshot and album formats: ability to create ZIP files with images. When this feature is
			enabled, it will go through all existing videos / albums and create the required ZIP files. Therefore you
			can enable it at any time.
		</li>
		<li>
			In order to further optimize new video conversion, we allowed screenshot formats to be optionally created
			on conversion servers. Earlier they could only be created on main server. Starting with 2.4.0 the
			conversion script remote_cron.php, which is located on every conversion server, provides ability to specify
			imagemagick path. If you do this, screenshot formats will start creating on conversion servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video upload and editing block (video_edit) was extended with ability for a user to select the main video
			screenshot.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to see which third-party domains are using embed codes from your website was introduced.
		</li>
		<li>
			Audit logging for all actions with videos and albums performed by administrators and website users was
			added. The log of these actions is available now in Settings section as Audit Log. It provides ability to
			see all performed actions with a particular video or album (who and when created it, modified it, removed
			it). Also it gives you full picture on what your content managers were doing for the given period of time.
			You can use audit log to check their progress, see how much they've done and etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new plugin for database repair was created. This plugin can display status for all tables and provides
			ability to repair them if needed. If any database problems are detected, you will see an error message on
			the start page.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new global option was added for video conversion configuration. It allows you selecting which video
			format (separately for standard and premium videos) should be used for detecting the global video duration,
			which is displayed on website in most cases. In previous versions the global duration was always detected
			based on video source file, which doesn't always make sense. For example if you upload source files with
			big duration, but all video formats are time-limited trailers (e.g. promo videos 3-5 minutes), the global
			video duration will be set incorrectly from source file. Now in such cases you can specify which video
			format should be checked for duration.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new website block was added for displaying a list of top search queries submitted into your website
			internal search.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new video / album validation option was added for utility purposes. The option is available from video /
			album context menu in admin panel. It executes one single validation for the selected video / album and
			checks availability of all video / album files and images.
		</li>
		<li>
			The default set of templates was translated to Russian language and can optionally be chosen during
			installation.
		</li>
		<li>
			New highly-demanded plugins were added: tags autogeneration, categories autogeneration and words-replacer
			in titles and descriptions for videos / albums. Enjoy!
		</li>
		<li>
			Background conversion engine was extended with pause mode, which can be useful in special cases. Conversion
			engine does not allow you add / change / remove any formats during tasks processing. If new tasks come
			regularly for your project it may be difficult to find a "silent" period when you can make the required
			changes. In order to solve this problem, we added pause mode, which can be enabled in System Settings.
			After you enable this option, the conversion engine will need some time to finish the tasks that have
			already been started, and then it will be paused.
		</li>
		<li>
			System settings were additionally extended with 2 new options, which allow configuring some start page
			alerts behavior. The first option will allow you disable annoying "KVS support access" alert. The second
			option provides ability to configure the limit of overload protection events, which trigger issue on the
			start page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Albums and videos list blocks (list_videos and list_albums) were updated with the ability to specify
			redirect pattern for search action, which will be used to redirect users when search result contains only 1
			item. In most cases you don't need to use this option, because its default behavior is to redirect to the
			video (album) page. However if you have a website section for mobile devices, its search is usually
			implemented on another page and redirection is required to another video (album) page as well - in this
			case you should use this new block parameter to specify the correct redirect pattern.
		</li>
		<li>
			Internal website search was greatly optimized by using selective caching.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to easily duplicate any existing website page was introduced. This feature is extremely useful when
			you need a test page for any reasons or when you are going to create a new version of the existing page.
			For example you can create a new version of video view page (video_view_v2) by duplicating the old one.
			Then you can spend days working with the new page, change its concept and contents, test it - and finally
			in order to switch your website to using the V2 page you only have to modify a rule (or couple of rules) in
			htaccess, that's it! If you need you can leave your old page and switch back to it at any time later.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video exporting feeds were extended with categorization filters: by category, by tag, by model and by
			content source. Due to potential overload it is possible now to specify caching time for every feed.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new priority option was added to conversion servers settings - it allows you to customize background
			process priority (nice) for every conversion server. The global option, which is available in system
			settings, now works only in the context of main server.
		</li>
		<li>
			Administrators can now mark videos with any flag (so-called administrator flag). Also videos list can be
			filtered by this flag value and mass-edit functionality can be used to set this flag. This new feature can
			help your content managers to cooperate between each other. Please note that you can create any number of
			flags in categorization section.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video upload and editing block (video_edit) was enhanced with ability to upload video files using remote
			HTTP links, which was possible only in admin panel before. This feature requires website template changes
			and thus it will not be available in the update.
		</li>
		<li>
			Content sources block (list_content_sources) was enhanced with ability to filter content sources by
			category group.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.

	<ul>
		<li>
			Backup plugin added, which allows you to backup your database, website templates and configurations, as
			well as KVS system files.
		</li>
		<li>
			We returned back the possibility to export sources for video screenshots and albums. This feature is
			available both for manual export module and for exporting feeds. In feeds you should enable the
			corresponding option in order to enable screenshots sources in this feed: otherwise feed will not expose
			links to screenshots sources by default.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to customize how video edit page is displayed was added to personal settings in admin panel. There
			are 2 possible options: "full" and "desc-writer". If you choose "desc-writer" option you can edit videos
			with less fields; also a preview player will be displayed right a way without any additional actions.
		</li>
		<li>
			RSS feeds import support was added. KVS will be able to parse RSS feeds, which provide links to video
			galleries. Galleries are web pages with a single video file or a set of video files that form a single
			video.
		</li>
		<li>
			User transactions stats can now show the number of users that were redirected to payment processor as well
			as the number of declined transactions.
		</li>
		<li>
			We added support for Zombaio (zombaio.com) payment processor. The integration is however in beta-testing
			phase.
		</li>
		<li>
			The list of background tasks in admin panel now displays error code for tasks which ended up with error.
			This feature gives you ability to sort out tasks with specific errors.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ability to search videos and albums by their website page URL was added to admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Own embed code concept was completely refactored. Now there is no need to pass video file URL and preview
			image URL in the embed code itself. Instead of these parameters embed code will contain only video ID,
			which will be used to build video file and preview image URLs at runtime. This change was implemented due
			to various usecases when video file URL may change for a video's embed code. For instance, you may want to
			display another video format file in embed codes, or you have migrated a video from one server group to
			another: in both cases embed codes may become invalid. This change will guarantee that such problems will
			never occur in the future.
		</li>
		<li>
			Plugin added, which allows you create a video of the given duration and quality from a single image (video
			file will just render this image). Such video can be used in antihotlink protection settings, so that KVS
			will show it for users who triggered antihotlink protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for Reflected Networks, Inc. CDN streaming.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added ability to show separately men / women in website's models lists.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_3_1">KVS v2.3.1 [12.08.2011]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Conversion engine was changed to ffmpeg 0.8. The concept of watermark overlaying was changed in this
			library version. In connection with this you shall also update ffmpeg to a new version (not less than 0.8)
			during KVS upgrade.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additional option of video resize was added to video format settings, which allows you to select either the
			preservation of the original video ratio (as it always worked previously), or crop video to correct ratio.
			This option is important for formats that you plan to use for mobile devices, and which shall have a fixed
			size regardless of original video file ratio.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to limit download speed of video files of a format was added to video format settings. Use cases
			may be: limit download speed of free videos, limit download speed of videos being watched through embed
			code, limit download speed of videos, which are allowed to be hotlinked by partners, etc. Speed limit will
			only work if videos are streamed using nginx.
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of conditionally-optional video formats was introduced. Conditionally-optional formats unlike
			merely optional formats may be created automatically, but only in cases where the source video allows
			creating such format based on its duration and size. For example, you want all the videos to be in 3
			different size formats: SD, HD and Full HD. For example, not all of your sources allow you to create Full
			HD format. You can make this format conditionally-optional, and as a result it will only be created with
			those sources that allow it, and will not be created with others.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cropping settings were added to photo albums and the feature to configure the level of user access to photo
			sources (previously, only the administrator had the access to photo sources). Thus, you can display photo
			sources at the website as one of photo album formats.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to display geometric size of photos and their file size on disk was added to photo albums. This
			is true for any format of photo albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to display only videos which screenshots were rotated by rotator was added to list_videos block.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to respond to a feedback message from admin panel was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to assign the group of content sources appeared for individual website users, where they can
			add their own videos or photos. This is done mainly for the convenience of webmasters, who add their own
			videos / photos from your website, so that they could tie videos / photos to their content sources only and
			find them in the list quicker (the list will contain only content sources from the group that was selected
			for this webmaster).
		</li>
		<li>
			JavaScript callback was added to the player that is invoked when the player is loaded.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_3_0">KVS v2.3.0 [27.06.2011]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Functionality of photo albums was significantly expanded and almost brought to functionality of video
			content. First, support of the deferred date of appearing on website was added to photo albums, i.e. post
			date. Second, import, export and mass edit options were added to photo albums in admin panel. These options
			work correspondingly with similar video options.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can tie photo albums to videos. To do this, the field is added in admin panel on photo album
			editing page that allows you to specify video for the album. Thus, you can tie several photo albums to a
			one video (they will be displayed at video editing page). You can display the list of photo albums for
			video through list_albums block at the website. Similarly, for photo album, you can display a video tied to
			it through list_videos block.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can restart any background tasks terminated with error. This option is available in the context
			menu on background task list in admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can see the percentage of execution of long background tasks. If previously, when starting the task
			of creating new format of screenshots, you could wait for days without information on task progress, now %
			of execution is displayed for any long task.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now it's possible to collectively recreate any screenshot or photo album formats. This feature is available
			in format context menu on the list of formats in admin panel. Selecting it, all the screenshots / images of
			the given format will be recreated (with new options of course) for all video / albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			2 small add-ons added to the rotator. Firstly, it is now possible to enable forcing of displaying the best
			CTR screenshots for separate video lists at the website (list_videos block), even if some videos on these
			lists still in the process of rotation. This can be used, for example, for website index page, where it is
			always best to display only the most clickable thumbs. Second, it is now possible to display only the
			videos, which screenshots were not yet rotated. Thus, you can create a separate website page with such
			videos and redirect "trash" traffic there to speed up rotation.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to migrate video from one group of servers to another was added to mass video editing. This
			feature will be useful for further expansion of the project, when you want to add new video formats, and
			there is not enough space on existing servers. To solve this problem, you can add new server group, migrate
			some videos there and create new formats utilizing the space which became free.
		</li>
		<li>
			A unique feature to debug website pages was added, which in most cases will make your work with design or
			with adding new pages much easier. To get debug data on any site page, you should add <b>?debug=true</b>
			parameter to page address. For this to work, you must be logged in to admin page. Debug data shows
			EVERYTHING that can be displayed at this address: what page in the engine is responsible for what you see
			on the screen, which components are used in the page template, which blocks are inserted at the page,
			configuration values of all blocks, and most importantly - as in any debugger, the list of all variables
			that you can use in the templates, as well as their current values! We hope that this new feature of KVS
			engine helps you to understand the details of website configuration and customization quicker and with
			fewer expenses.
		</li>
		<li>
			Checking of all required KVS installation files was added to audit plugin. This check should allow at any
			time to obtain the information about custom changes in software made in your project.
		</li>
		<li>
			Logging of all system processes was expanded, so that at any moment it was possible to get a log of the
			last launch of any process. A list of system logs, as well as information about KVS installation at your
			server is available on a new page in admin panel in the settings section (Installation info).
		</li>
		<li>
			Additional option of pseudo-random sorting was added to list_videos and random_video blocks, which operates
			several times faster than normal random MySQL sorting. Test results on several resources showed that random
			sorting significantly slows down the retrieval of data for a large number of objects. Pseudo-random sorting
			works several times faster.
		</li>
		<li>
			Postfix <b>(w)</b> next to the user name appeared on video / album lists in admin panel, if that user is a
			webmaster.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.

		</li>
		<li>
			Rotator settings were completely transferred to system settings, and made available for everyone. A section
			about rotator was added to documentation.
		</li>
		<li>
			A feature to filter the list of videos in admin panel by completion of screenshot rotation was added, as
			well as a feature to display CTR for each video and sort by it.
		</li>
		<li>
			A feature to reset rotator statistics was added to mass editing.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new button "Delete and open next" appeared at video and album editing pages in admin panel, in addition

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_2_1">KVS v2.2.1 [22.04.2011]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In some website blocks the feature was added to display a tree structure of videos: by categories, models
			and content sources. Thus, for example, you can display a list of content sources and show N videos with
			desired sorting for each content source (rated by popularity, by rotator, etc.). Similarly, you can do for
			categories and models.
		</li>
		<li>
			SMS billing smspay.lenden.ru is connected.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to specify the size and skin for the player at video export was added for embed codes that are
			generated for your videos by exporting. It is useful to you if you use your embed codes on other projects:
			different projects can require embed codes with different sizes of the player and even with different
			skins.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to look at results of recent audits (up to 7 days ago) appeared in audit plugin. This is done
			in order not to wait until the end of current audit (full audit may take several hours), but easily run it,
			close the page and open it in some time to see the result.
		</li>
		<li>
			Minor additions to comments and website events were made. The option to display user sex was added
			everywhere (for a comment or an event).
		</li>
		<li>
			It is now possible to skip the first feed line in CSV feeds. Some websites give CSV feeds with the header
			line that lists the names of columns and their order. The option which skips the header line is designed to
			support such feeds.
		</li>
		<li>
			Export feed usage is expanded. If previously feeds could transfer only the information about videos that
			you were hosting, now hotlinked videos get into export feeds, as well as pseudo-videos and embed codes.
			This allows you to fully synchronize the content between your projects.
		</li>
		<li>
			At the page with video screenshots, the tick was added for simultaneous selection of all screenshots for
			deletion. This is useful if you delete more screenshots, than you leave - in this case, it will be quicker
			to select all at once and manually deselect only those screenshots that you want to leave.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to move public videos to private videos and vice versa was added to mass edit.
		</li>
		<li>
			A block parameter, which allows showing only those videos that have a file of the specified format, was
			added to list_videos block.
		</li>
		<li>
			Allocation of new tasks by conversion servers is randomized. If previously the tasks were added to
			conversion server in turn up to the limit completion of each server, now the tasks are spread out randomly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_2_0">KVS v2.2.0 [24.03.2011]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Beta-version of rotator: the feature, which everyone had been waiting for long, was finally done! In
			version 2.2.0 we made video rotator only, but potentially in the future we have no problem to add a rotator
			for photo albums, content sources, models and DVDs. Video rotator works on 2 levels: at first level, the
			screenshots are rotated within one video to identify the most clickable(s). You can automatically remove N
			of screenshots with worst CTR. At second level, the rotation is active on all videos to identify the most
			clickable videos among others. Details of the rotator will be available in the documentation for future
			versions. So far as the feature is serious and affects the very heart of the website engine, it is locked
			by default and will be unlocked in the future. We invite people wishing to take part in beta-testing to
			create tickets on this question.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can hotlink your videos from other domains with conservation of antihotlink protection. This
			feature will allow you to quickly and cheaply create dozens of other resources through hotlinking of your
			own videos streamed by KVS. At that, it will be possible to hotlink only from your resources, e.g. nobody
			else can do it.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to create clones was reworked, partially using the existing database. Let's recall that KVS
			allows you to create resources for a physically single database with a separate set of pages and design, as
			well as separate statistics. Data for videos, comments, users, etc. are common to all resources.
		</li>
		<li>
			The plugin was added to clear smarty cache. The plugin allows you to see the size of file cache, which is
			used by website pages and to schedule its clearing.
		</li>
		<li>
			Integration with smsdostup.ru billing was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few corrections in embed player. The option was added in player settings to disable the feature to copy
			embed code for your videos at the website. Also, partnership referral parameter substitution was added to
			embed code that appears in the player at the website. Thus, visitors from your partner will take embed code
			with his referral parameter.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can use the flags as a rating. You can assign weight for each flag to be added (taken away) to the
			rating. Thus, you can sort videos by rating obtained from flags.
		</li>
		<li>
			The option was added to video import, which allows you to skip videos with names already existing in the
			database. Previously, warnings were always triggered for such videos, but they were always created that may
			be undesirable.
		</li>
		<li>
			We improved the usability of screenshot selection during the manual grabbing - you can now click on thumbs
			and they will be selected in the same sequence as you click.
		</li>
		<li>
			In signup block, we added the feature to check for the existence of the given login / email in database via
			ajax (check for duplicates).
		</li>
		<li>
			A small API for remote user management was added to integrate with other scripts of forums / websites /
			partnerships. API allows you to create a user, grant premium access to the user and take away premium
			access. In the future, API will be extended as per your requests.
		</li>
		<li>
			Minor player corrections. Now you can specify the algorithm of video scaling: (a) preserve aspect ratio,
			(b) stretch without saving ratio and (c) cut edges. This amendment is not very relevant to software (as
			player has the same aspect ratio as video in video_view block). But it can be useful if you show the player
			of a fixed size. In this case, depending on video ratio, the black bars may appear that may be undesirable.
		</li>
		<li>
			2 extra custom fields were added to category object.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The number of player slots was extended from 3 to 5.
		</li>
		<li>
			The detalization by errors was added when saving storage or conversion FTP server: connection error, login
			error or account error.
		</li>
		<li>
			A check to download content was added to the function to check servers in the audit plugin from all storage
			servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			A block displaying a random video was added (random_video). The block allows showing one video, taken
			randomly according to the defined rules. For example, random video of the top 10 for today, random video of
			the 20 highest-rated in the category "Category", etc. - range of options is quite large.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to specify the order of video processing by a feed was added to importing feeds - direct or
			reverse order.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to take main screenshot from the feed and create the rest automatically was added to importing
			feeds. Previously, feed could only take one screenshot or create all the screenshots automatically.
		</li>
		<li>
			Displaying of timeline screenshots was added to video viewing in the admin panel, if they are enabled in
			the player settings and exist for this video format.
		</li>
		<li>
			A new testing option was added to audit plugin - content protection check. This option checks that all
			necessary protection against hotlinking and unauthorized access to the video is enabled and correctly
			configured in nginx configuration. In particular, checks on direct access failure to video sources and
			video format files are carried out. Besides checking videos KVS also similarly checks access to photo
			albums sources and protected formats, which should not have a possibility of direct access.
		</li>
		<li>
			Some player problems were fixed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_1_0">KVS v2.1.0 [17.01.2011]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			News plug-in was added, which draws news information from KVS website 2 times a day and shows news on start
			page.
		</li>
		<li>
			New version of player was integrated with a large number of tweaks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Storage of video screenshots sources was moved to the same folder where video sources are stored (and which
			should be closed from direct access), thus video screenshot sources will be protected from unauthorized
			access.
		</li>
		<li>
			Additional logic was added to process timeline screenshots when ffmpeg for some reason cannot take a
			screenshot in the required point.
		</li>
		<li>
			New plug-in of integration video search with external search engines. You can partially or fully switch
			video search at your website to use third-party search with displaying external results at your website.
			This allows you to sell search traffic from your website.
		</li>
		<li>
			To optimize video search at the website, parameters were added to list_videos block that separately
			configure search by categories, tags, models, content sources and DVD.
		</li>
		<li>
			Smartscripts feed parser was switched to work in reverse mode (start video processing from the end of the
			feed).
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>

	<h2 id="section_whats_new_2_0">KVS v2.0</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_6">KVS v2.0.6 [30.12.2010]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The content of photo albums was completely restructured. Now photo albums support multi-format structure,
			as well as videos. Photo album processing was moved to background tasks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support of content sources and models was added to the photo albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can deny access to certain formats of photo albums for not privileged users.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to adjust list columns (in personal settings) appeared for photo albums in the admin panel, and
			also the buttons similar to video "Save and edit next" and "Save and add more" were added.
		</li>
		<li>
			The filter was added in logging of video converting process that allows filtering out many similar messages
			generated by ffmpeg, leaving only a small part of them. This is done in order to increase the availability
			of video conversion logs.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added in video import to set the number of days in the future, during which the video will
			be distributed, in addition to a specific date range. This is useful if you regularly use import schemes
			and always upload videos to the same interval in the future (for example, for a week forward).
		</li>
		<li>
			One of video import / export schemes can be specified as the default scheme, and it will be automatically
			selected when you open video import / export page.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to the list of video formats in the admin panel to switch the structure of the list
			between 2 modes: standard (as was before) and the access and protection mode, which shows several other
			columns of the table, emphasizing for access settings of video formats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Manual screenshots grabbing can now add new overview video screenshots (previously you could only replace
			the existing ones).
		</li>
		<li>
			Audit plugin was extended to check the complete content of photo albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_5">KVS v2.0.5 [07.12.2010]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Now you can specify which video formats are available for download.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can turn off the global antihotlink protection for individual video formats. It may be necessary if
			you want to give others the opportunity to hotlink your videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Export feeds support was added. You can create export feeds which can be used by your partners to
			periodically request information about your videos. Export feeds provide partners with a convenient
			opportunity to choose feed format by themselves (KVS or CSV with the ability to specify the list and order
			of the columns), and also select the appropriate screenshot format (if you have configured multi-format
			structure of screenshots) and indicate some of the other filters and sorting.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added in the settings of embed player to specify what video format will be used to generate
			embed code. Thus, you can create particular formats for displaying them in embed codes from third-party
			resources.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now your partners can pass their partner ref through the parameters of embed code and player links will
			contain their ref if configured. This will allow your partners, for example, to use your embed codes to
			promote your resource and get their % of revenue, like when using simple referral links to your resource.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.

	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_4">KVS v2.0.4 [15.11.2010]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Epoch billing support was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Importing video feeds were added. Importing feeds allow you to schedule and automate video import by using
			the feeds provided by third-parties. KVS supports several feed formats: KVS (xml), SmartScripts (xml) and
			CSV (ability to configure columns and separator). Besides that you can configure different video adding
			modes (such as embed codes, hotlink videos, download videos and store them), screenshots creation modes
			(use feeds screenshots or create own screenshots).
		</li>
		<li>
			A new plugin was added to create category avatars based on videos in these categories on scheduled basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video mass edit was extended to provide ability to reset a video flag for the selected videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Videos list block was tweaked to provide info about video formats for every video in the list.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cron related overload protection stopped warn you on start page and only logs itself in stats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can turn off the global antihotlink protection for individual video formats. It may be necessary if
			you want to give others the opportunity to hotlink your videos.

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_3">KVS v2.0.3 [31.10.2010]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The mechanism of video balancing between multiple servers (CDN) was slightly changed. Now the same video is
			downloaded from the same server within 5 minutes. Thus the distribution of video download changes every 5
			minutes. It is done in order to further accelerate download of video content, as downloading the same video
			from a single server we increase the probability of usage of local nginx and operating system cache and
			reduce load on hard drives.
		</li>
		<li>
			Separate RSS feeds were added for videos by categories and videos by tags.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature of mass change of the video rating was added to mass edit.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to video import to set content source globally for all imported videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video flagging was added. You can create any number of flags, and for each video you can vote for one of
			the flags. For every flag you can specify after which number of votes it shall display a warning on start
			page. You can also turn on the display of information about flags in separate columns of videos list in
			admin panel (this can be enabled in personal settings, where video list columns are configured).
		</li>
		<li>
			CCbill billing support was added.
		</li>

	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_2">KVS v2.0.2 [11.10.2010]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The default templates were changed in order to display HTML title and description tags on videos by
			categories pages based on category custom fields.
		</li>
		<li>
			VIP video and VIP users were removed, which lasted from version 1.5.0 and have not been used by customers.
			They were removed, because their presence complicated some aspects of new member zone and restrictions.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to customize alternative screenshots storages and their random usage at the website.
			This is done to speed up website page loading with a large number of pictures, because if part of pictures
			is loaded from one domain (subdomain), and another part from another - this gives the visual effect of
			quicker website displaying.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to bulk confirm users in the list in admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Website search statistics collection was optimized.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_1">KVS v2.0.1 [26.09.2010]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Analysis logic of all the screenshots was added to conversion engine, and in the case of appearance of gray
			screenshots, their automatic re-creation is done using more complex and long method (fast ffmpeg screenshots
			creation in some cases produces gray screenshots, evenly distributed throughout the video).
		</li>
		<li>
			If streaming format files (flv, mp4) are uploaded manually, now the engine will still upload them to the
			conversion server to verify that they are ready for streaming (metadata for flv, moov container for mp4).
		</li>
		<li>
			Website and in admin panel uploaders were extended to check 413 nginx error, which appears if uploaded file
			has a size greater than allowed. Now correct message is displayed instead of error code.
		</li>
		<li>
			Few small corrections and bugs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_2_0_0">KVS v2.0.0 [17.09.2010]</h3>
	<h4>Conversion engine and storage concept of videos / screenshots was completely rewritten</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			For each type of video - standard (public and private) and premium - now you can specify a separate list of
			formats that will be created automatically based on the source. Each of these formats allows you to specify
			individual settings and restrictions on the duration of the video (in seconds or in %, number of parts from
			which the video should be formed), separate watermark image.
		</li>
		<li>
			The possibility to enable saving of video source.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video formats can be removed / added at any time. When removing a format, all files of this format will be
			removed automatically, when adding - they will be additionally created on the basis of video source or on
			the basis of files of other formats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Screenshots are divided into 2 groups: overview and timeline. Overview screenshots are created based on
			video source and present the video for a user. You can set either a fixed number of overview screenshots
			for all videos or the interval at which they will be made (thus, videos of different duration will have a
			different number of overview screenshots). Timeline screenshots are configured for each video format
			separately and are created based on files of this format (and not the source). Timeline screenshots are
			intended for displaying at video key points in the player, but may also be used in other places where you
			need to show a camera report of the video.
		</li>
		<li>
			For overview and timeline screenshots you can specify separate formats. You can specify a separate size,
			separate quality settings, and separate watermark image for each format of screenshots. Screenshots formats
			can be added / removed at any time, the required files will be created / deleted automatically.
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of a conversion queue and conversion servers was added. Now any operations with content are
			created as tasks (9 types of tasks). Some tasks are executed on the main server and do not require
			conversion servers. Tasks that include working with video content are running on conversion server(s). At
			installation time, one default conversion server is created, which is physically located at the same server.
			If necessary, you can add any number of third-party conversion servers and execute all of the most
			complicated operations there. This can be done at any time (it is only needed to install the necessary
			server libraries on conversion server and copy a small PHP script). Thus, we resolved important issue of
			conversion performance optimization.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support for multi-server storage of video was expanded:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> Now you can customize the load balancing of video streaming between servers in one server group
			by weight coefficients as well as by country (CDN organization). So, having servers in the U.S. and Europe,
			you can display the same video to different users from different servers.<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> FTP support was added when working with multi-servers.<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> Constant background check for video files on all servers was added, thus you will know any
			failure in the storage system.<br/>
			<b>(d)</b> Now you can check video streaming from each server by direct link or through download script.
			This is done so that when enabling / disabling antihotlink protection, you can quickly verify that all
			works as required.
		</li>
		<li>
			Manual operation with screenshots was re-worked taking into account multi-format support and splitting
			screenshots to overview / timeline groups. Creating new screenshots from video was put on the background
			displaying the progress bar, what made it much more convenient (in the first place, you see how much is
			left to wait, and secondly, you can continue working with the admin panel in the same browser - it was
			impossible previously).
		</li>
		<li>
			Import and export of videos was rewritten taking into account all new features and some serious issues
			found in previous versions:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> It is possible to skip lines that caused the error.<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> It is possible to specify the video duration in standard format (previously it can be specified
			only by number of seconds).<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> We added a feature to specify a list of users who post videos, so that you don't need to specify
			separately for each video, but you can specify a single list from which the user will be randomly selected
			for each video.<br/>
			<b>(d)</b> The operation of import data check was put on the background displaying the progress bar. Also,
			major waiting problems were corrected, which customers faced in the previous versions when importing a
			large number of videos.<br/>
			<b>(e)</b> It is possible now to specify video screenshots in the archive.
		</li>
		<li>
			Complete logging of video conversion and post-conversion processes was added. We have tried to derive as
			much useful information as possible that will allow quickly finding any problems and operatively resolving
			them. Logs on each video are now available in videos list in the admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support of 5th type of content was added - fake video.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video mass edit feature was added, which allows not only mass editing some fields of the selected (or all)
			videos, but also allows for much more:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> Select video publishing date in the specified range - that is, randomly distribute videos to different
			dates.<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> Add or remove tags, categories and models.<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> Create or recreate files of selected video formats.<br/>
			<b>(d)</b> Mass delete source files.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Website engine and performance</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			We optimized the most troubled website blocks: list_categories, list_tags, tags_cloud.
		</li>
		<li>
			Protection against server overload was enhanced. Statistics was added on triggering of overload protection.
		</li>
		<li>
			Collection and displaying of performance statistics for individual pages and blocks was added. This
			statistic is very important to optimize various website aspects. It allows you to analyze the caching
			strategy and adjust it, and also find the most critical factors in terms of performance. Also the feature
			to reset the accumulated performance statistics was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Search in templates was added in admin panel. This is very convenient if you need to change some design
			aspect in bulk that could potentially be in several places of your website. Now you can search for anything
			directly from the admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of pagination was changed: URLs now render page numbers, and not numbers of the first element
			on the page as it was previously. Also, any list can be changed into AJAX pagination, while keeping the
			old-way links for search engines.
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of including javascripts was changed. Now they are included automatically, depending on the
			blocks that are inserted in page. Each block knows which javascript is required and includes it.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Player and its use in KVS</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The feature to set user redirect when you click on the video area during playback was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Display of permalink was added (link to the page with this video at your website).
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to specify advertising string in player control bar and click URL on it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can specify that all links from the player are opened in the same browser window.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can show related videos in the player.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can protect videos from copying through capture software (you can set the interval at which
			customized text is shown in various parts of the player, such as IP and current user login, for example).
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can show video timeline screenshots for the current video file (if they are enabled for this video
			format) as you scroll.
		</li>
		<li>
			In player embed mode for different advertising options now you can redirect user to a page with this video
			at your website.
		</li>
		<li>
			In connection with the added video multi-format feature, now you can customize the list of formats for
			users with different access levels (as in YouTube - 360p, 480p, etc. - all this is configurable). It is
			very hard to explain these options quickly; they need to be thoroughly investigated. Using them you can,
			for example, set non-registered users to view only a shortened video version in bad quality, but selecting
			720p option, they will go to sponsor's website, or to your sign-up page or just somewhere else. At the same
			time registered users can watch videos in HD, using the same 720p option. This is just one of dozens of
			usage examples; your fantasy is unlimited here, except the fact that the maximum number of options in the
			list is 3.
		</li>
		<li>
			In general, the feature was added to specify different player settings for different types of users. Thus,
			you can show ads in the player for guests only, and not show it for members, etc. KVS has 3 access levels
			for users: unregistered (guests), standard and premium users.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Various aspects of operation and administration</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The link to the website from admin panel was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can fully customize the columns of video list in the admin panel (which now are much more) in the
			personal user settings. Also you can show a thumb on the video list in the admin panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to view video directly from the list in the admin panel was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to lock individual videos so that they cannot be edited or deleted at the website was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			DVDs were introduced, which can be used to group together a list of video (scenes). DVDs are independent
			objects that can be shown at the website as a list, show DVD data, the lists of scenes for them, they can
			be rated and comments can be added for them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Custom fields in the categories and category groups were added.
		</li>
		<li>
			For all pages in the admin panel, a unique HTML &lt;title&gt; was made, thus history navigation became
			easier, and it is now easier to deal with several open windows.
		</li>
		<li>
			Rating and comments for content sources and models were added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Set of personal data of models was expanded for models.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Statistics</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Statistics was fully transferred to a JS+cookie concept. Calculation of no-cookie traffic was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Calculation of your embed code displays on other sites was added. When you set referrers for monitoring -
			the number of embed codes will also be recorded for referrers.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature to reset statistics for a specified period was added.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Website and website blocks</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Login block - now you can set up protection against logins from multiple people using the same account. You
			can specify the number of unique IP, IP masks, browsers and countries, which are allowed for a specified
			period of time. If for any member at least one of these conditions is violated - there comes the ban. There
			may be two types of the ban: temporary - when the email is sent to user asking to confirm, and permanent
			ban. You can adjust the number of permitted temporary bans after which comes a permanent ban. Of course you
			will be able to see the information why the user was banned and how many times, you can unban him if
			necessary.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now calculate the time the logged in user is at the website (optional). Thus, for each user, you
			can see average time spent by him at the website. Also, this feature allows displaying "online" indicator
			for each user and displaying users that are "online" right now.
		</li>
		<li>
			Several corrections were made to all comments (for videos, albums, models, DVDs, and content sources):<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> Not only IP is logged, but also the country.<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> The feature to customize the behavior of captcha (whether to display to everyone, to guests
			only, do not show to anyone).<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> If comments are set to appear immediately at the website, they nevertheless will fall in the
			list to check in the admin panel (previously, in this case the comments did not fall in the list to check).
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to the lists of categories and tags to sort the items by average rating of videos
			(albums) in that category / tag, and similar by the average popularity of videos (albums).
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to the lists of models and content sources to sort items by the average rating and
			average popularity of the videos that are related to the model / content source.
		</li>
		<li>
			Block of feedback was added, which allows users to write any information to service administrators.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now anonymous users can upload videos (only members could do it previously). Now it's possible to do some
			of the fields optional (remove check), for example, description, tags, categories.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can display the global list of images from photo albums - without connection to the albums.
		</li>
		<li>
			In many list blocks, the feature was added to filter the items with empty description.
		</li>
		<li>
			The feature was added to display the members of the website from the country of current user.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Software plugins</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Audit plugin allows you to test different aspects of your installation and operation::<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> Availability of required privileges on system files.<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> Integrity of the database.<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> Correctness of all formats of video and screenshots (for the test video it is trying to create
			files of all video and screenshots formats).<br/>
			<b>(d)</b> Caching of website pages and blocks.<br/>
			<b>(e)</b> Deep content verification - completely checks for availability and size of all video files and
			screenshots.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="section_whats_new_1_5">KVS v1.5</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_1_5_0">KVS v1.5.0 [13.01.2010]</h3>
	<h4>Conversion of primary video file and trailer, system settings</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Now, two-pass encoding added for ffmpeg, which results in better quality of encoded videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Watermark support added (PNG transparency also supported), with placement in a custom video corner, or in
			a random one.
		</li>
		<li>
			Several priority coefficients added for priority management of encoding processes.
		</li>
		<li>
			Customizable encoding error logging added (no logging, full logging, logging errors only).
		</li>
		<li>
			Customizable encoding options, size and separate watermarks are now available for trailers.
		</li>
		<li>
			The website now plays back the videos adjusting player height to the video proportions, taking into account
			the width specified.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Screenshot creation and manual screenshot cropping</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			4 fields of ImageMagick options are replaced with a single command line with size tokens.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cropping is now a separate feature with customizable crop values from 4 sides of the images, set in px or %.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can customize the screenshot creation method for cases when video aspect ratio differs from the
			desired screenshot aspect ratio. You can select either saving valuable graphic information (black lines may
			show on the sides in this case), or cropping the picture to bring it to desired aspect ratio (no black
			lines in this case, unless the original video had them).
		</li>
		<li>
			For manual screenshot creation, you can now select the creation library (ffmpeg / mplayer) and customize
			the crop value for this action (system crop settings will remain unchanged).
		</li>
		<li>
			In addition to screenshots of custom sizes, images of original size are now always saved for later usage
			(e.g. for exporting them to third party sites). Also, preview image of the main screenshot is saved and
			used as a preview image in the player.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Protecting videos from hotlinking and unauthorized access</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Server-side direct file access protection for Nginx was added (via X-Accel-Redirect). This can also be
			enabled when content is stored on remote servers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now, you can set up user account types which can see the full video. For instance, you can allow full
			videos only for premium and VIP members. In this case only users with such account types will see the full
			video while unregistered users and users with other account types will see trailers (if enabled), or 403
			error.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Premium membership, access levels, payment processing</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In addition to premium accounts, we now added VIP users, so now you can set up features of your site
			available to different categories of users:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> Unregistered users (e.g. they can see only limited trailers, not more than 5 per day).<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> Registered users (e.g. they can see as many trailers as they want).<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> Premium users (e.g. they can see full standard videos).<br/>
			<b>(d)</b> VIP members (e.g. they can see full videos including hi-quality VIP videos).
		</li>
		<li>
			VIP videos can now be created, in addition to premium videos.
		</li>
		<li>
			Starting from the Advanced package, the script now supports SMS and bank card payment processing. Currently
			we integrated SegPay and SmsCoin scripts. We will add other processors of both types as our customers will
			submit requests, as we require a testing server to integrate a payment processing script. If you are
			interested in seeing more processors added, contact us. Ideally, when several other processors will be
			added, you will be able to set up backup processing (either SMS or bank card payments) which the site will
			switch to instantly as soon as primary processor goes down, or in other situations. Payment processing is
			still new to KVS, and we will certainly add lots of new features, using our customers' requests as
			guidelines.
		</li>
		<li>
			For bank card and SMS payment processing, you can set up pricing packages. Each package includes a user
			account type (premium or VIP) to be assigned to the user after payment is complete. You can use different
			packages and different pricing for premium and VIP account types.
		</li>
		<li>
			Website signup block now includes SMS and bank card payment support, and you can still leave free
			registration available at the same time. If you want, you can disable free registration in the block
			settings. In addition to fees paid during registration, if you have free access enabled, users can register
			for free first and then upgrade their account. Members who paid via SMS can extend their memberships in the
			same manner.
		</li>
		<li>
			Overall transaction stats, user activity stats and user login stats were added.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Player and player settings in administration panel</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The player was tweaked and improved in so many ways, visually as well as functionally:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> Stop button added.<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> Outgoing URL for the logo can now be set up.<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> Ads shown when the video is paused or stopped were added.<br/>
			<b>(d)</b> Player controls panel now has customizable behavior (always show, always hide, show only during
			user activity).<br/>
			<b>(e)</b> Embed code can now be shown in the player.<br/>
			<b>(f)</b> Light-colored skin support added.<br/>
			<b>(g)</b> Tons of minor tweaks for more stable operation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Administration panel now has a section with settings for the on-site and embed players (in settings
			section). The options are basically the same in both cases. Apart from standard player display options, the
			settings allow you to set up ads shown in the player. The ads could be either global banners or banners
			bound to content source supplying the video. All this now offers fast and easy configuration options.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Categorization and models</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			In addition to tags and categories, models are a new way to sort and structure the videos. Model pages have
			basic data fields, 2 screenshots of different sizes (customizable in system settings), and additional text
			and file fields for more customization.
		</li>
		<li>
			Categorizing your videos via administration panel is now easier due to improved usability. This includes
			categories, tags and models.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can categorize content sources (sponsors). The content sources list block (list_content_sources)
			now offers customizable display of content sources by categories.
		</li>
		<li>
			New blocks to be used while building your site were added:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> list_categories_group (displays the list of categories filtered and sorted in a customizable
			way).<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> list_models (displays the list of models filtered and sorted in a customizable way).<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> model_view (displays model information).
		</li>
		<li>
			The video list block (list_videos) now has a new feature of showing lists of videos sorted by models.
		</li>
		<li>
			The video list block (list_videos) now can display categories, tags and models for every video in the
			list.
		</li>
		<li>
			The category list block (list_categories) now can show categories split into groups.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now specify models while importing and exporting your videos.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Website</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Default website design now looks different.
		</li>
		<li>
			All list blocks now have internal paging and SE-friendly links (previously paging was a separate block
			only). The paging block is still there for backward compatibility and for extra paging features .
		</li>
		<li>
			Sitemap page is now added, generating the relevant XML structure automatically.
		</li>
		<li>
			The website now can make a more extensive use of sponsors. Now you can use new blocks to display sponsors
			reviews. The following blocks were added:<br/>
			<b>(a)</b> list_content_sources_groups (displays sponsor groups filtered and sorted in a customizable way).<br/>
			<b>(b)</b> content_source_view (displays sponsor information).<br/>
			<b>(c)</b> content_source_group_view (displays sponsor group information).
		</li>
		<li>
			Sponsors outgoing links can now be accessed in a SE-friendly way through the content source directory
			field.
		</li>
		<li>
			In those website blocks which support string search, search mode can now be selected (LIKE for the entire
			string, LIKE for all string elements, or FULLTEXT index usage).
		</li>
		<li>
			Latest blog entries for all site users can now be displayed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Other tweaks</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			"Webmaster" is the new user account type. Use it to allow video uploads from partners only. Webmasters is
			still a new feature for KVS, and we will be happy to get feedback from you concerning further development
			of this feature.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now manually delete tags from tag lists (previously, tags would be deleted only when unused).
		</li>
		<li>
			Exporting embed code for your videos is now available.
		</li>
		<li>
			5 more custom fields added for content sources.
		</li>
		<li>
			3 more custom file fields added for referrers.
		</li>
		<li>
			In administration panel, custom fields can now have names assigned to them.
		</li>
		<li>
			Video publishing date time can now be manually specified (previously, only date part was editable, now you can
			also edit the time within the set date).
		</li>
		<li>
			Ads can now be mass (de)activated.
		</li>
		<li>
			Lots of tweaks concerning website management in administration panel.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Videos are processed in a more stable way now, and the same goes for screenshot creation. Now, KVS allows
			choosing which server software should be used for video encoding and screenshot creation (MEncoder and
			MPlayer or FFmpeg).
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now create trailers of limited duration for the video files uploaded. In the settings, you can
			specify the duration in seconds or in % from the original video duration.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_1_4_0">KVS v1.4.0 [01.07.2009]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Block parameters were completely revised as a concept. Now, every block parameter is specified through a
			separate field, and different parameters have different fields. Now working with website customization is a
			lot easier.
		</li>
		<li>
			Videos can now be created from FHGs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Up to 3 dynamic HTTP parameters can be set up to be processed on top of caching. This is a major new thing
			for those who want to receive and process traffic from partners.
		</li>
		<li>
			New block was introduced, referrer top list, allowing for running basic traffic trade without extra
			software. The block can show the referrer list with certain options and display the list of videos with
			links to trade as well; skimming is also supported.
		</li>
		<li>
			New block was introduced, global website info displaying overall website data stats.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ad click stats were introduced.
		</li>
		<li>

			other webmasters insert the embed code with your video into third party websites, and your ads will be
			shown together with this video.
		</li>
		<li>
			Detailed documentation is now available for blocks and their parameters.
		</li>
		<li>
			A feature to save the mass video import/export settings is now available. If you regularly add videos from
			a single source with the same settings, this will save plenty of your time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Certain changes in the block displaying the list of internal messages. First, the one to initiate
			friendship now gets a system confirmation message. Then, the list of unread messages now shows regular
			message first, and then the friendship request notifications.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the login block, you can now enable captcha and bruteforce protection. These are crucial for building
			premium access areas.
		</li>
		<li>
			From now on, you can use settings to customize MEncoder command string for screenshots creation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Manual screenshot uploading has new features. Now you can upload screenshots of any sizes, and they will be

			A block was added to display any tag list, in addition to the current tag cloud block. The new block allows
			disabling unnecessary tag filtering to make it more efficient.
		</li>
		<li>

			have an option to display videos by content source directory, while previously it was possible only by
			content source ID.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the video list block, you can now render full category information, tag and content source in the video
			lists corresponding to these objects (e.g. you can show full content source information and display the
			video list for this content source nearby).
		</li>
		<li>
			Caching search results in video lists, photo albums and users blocks is now disallowed. Correspondingly,
			certain pages created specifically to display search results were dismissed as unnecessary.
		</li>
		<li>
			We introduced an additional configuration file containing settings for player pop-up ads. You can now show
			different ads for different content sources, and check stats for pop-up ad clicks.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="section_whats_new_1_3">KVS v1.3</h2>
	<h3 id="section_whats_new_1_3_0">KVS v1.3.0 [24.04.2009]</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Premium users and premium videos were added. Now, KVS can power a site with a subscription-based area where
			premium videos are available only to premium users, like it is on our demo site now. This is not it: you
			can create any relations between premium users and site videos you want.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the video_view block, you can now set up limitations on total videos viewed per a period of time. You
			can set up 3 limitations: for unlogged users (e.g. asking them to log in or register to watch more than 3
			videos per day), for standard users (e.g. asking them to purchase a premium membership) and for premium
			users as well, if you want.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now anonymous, unregistered users can leave comments. This can be disabled or enabled in the comments block
			settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			Global video view stats can now be checked, and no-referrer incoming traffic is now counted as well
			(i.e. bookmarkers).
		</li>
		<li>
			The video list block was improved: now it can show information on the video's content source (sponsor) for
			each and every video. Also, this block can now display all videos related to a chosen content source.
		</li>
		<li>
			A block with a customizable list of content sources (sponsors) was added.
		</li>
		<li>
			The concept of referrers was revamped, and now they are treated more like traders. You can set up a
			trader's title, description, and a link where the traffic will be sent. In the coming version, we will add
			the top referrers block which can be used to set up traffic trade.
		</li>
		<li>
			The demo website HTML layout concept was improved. Block templates used in multiple places (like video list
			or paging) were moved to separate components (includes). No templates are now duplicated, so it now takes
			less time to integrate your custom design.
		</li>
		<li>
			New photo album features were added. Finally, rating and comments are now available for every individual
			picture.
		</li>
		<li>
